pushing the dollar lower but by wednesday the dollar climbed to more than marks about five pfennigs above its levels the friday before the g accord the move was aided by indications that the u s economy picked up steam in february at the same time as the west german economy was regressing but dealers said the federal reserve bank of new york gave  rs a sharp reminder that the g pact had encompassed the idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines dealers differed as to whether the u s central bank actually intervened to sell dollars above marks or simply telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading conditions but the dollar quickly backed off it hovered today around marks the market was surprised that the fed showed its face so soon said marine

system the president of the arab bankers association said hikmat nashashibi told a news conference at the end of an arab currency  rs meeting we have to start with coordination of fiscal policies as a prerequisite for a common system of currencies there is quite a substantial way to go yet he said only then would a unified gulf currency system be a plausible project the six nations of the gulf

bankers say could be modelled on the european monetary system ems at present five currencies are linked either officially or in practice to the u s dollar while the kuwaiti dinar is pegged to a weighted basket of currencies a common currency system or ems style grid would in theory foster regional by providing a basis for stable exchange rates but nashashibi said inter arab is at a very low ebb and capital flows between gulf states remain small capital markets in the arab world are still in their infancy he said nashashibi said lack of experience among arab banks a paucity of financial

regime to provide dinar liquidity aid centred on the island s newly launched treasury bill programme the bahrain monetary agency has issued a circular to all commercial banks outlining a new policy from april which gives liquidity aid through sale and repurchase agreements in treasury bills or through discounting them the circular released officially to reuters said current arrangements for providing liquidity aid will no longer be valid except in quite exceptional circumstances under the current system the agency provides the island s commercial banks with dinar liquidity by means of short term swaps against u s dollars and less frequently by short term loans secured against government development bonds the agency considers that it is now appropriate to replace these operations with short term assistance based on government of bahrain treasury bills the circular to banks states the agency said it will repurchase treasury bills with a simultaneous agreement to resell them to the same bank at a higher price which will reflect an charge the agency said it envisages the repurchase agreements will normally be for a period of seven days bahrain launched a weekly tender for two mln dinars of day treasury bills in mid december last year and has since raised a total of mln dinars through the programme bahrain s commercial banks are currently liquid and have been making little use of the traditional dollar swaps offered by the agency but banking sources said the new regime from april will mean banks cannot afford not to hold treasury bills in case they need funds from the central bank banking sources said more than half of the banks hold treasury bills although the need by others to take up paper could increase demand at weekly tenders and push down allotted yields slightly last week s yield was six pct although the programme had started at the end of last year with rates as low as pct banking sources said the cost of liquidity through repurchase accords will not differ much from that on dollar swaps but a bank using dollars to obtain liquidity would foresake on the u s currency while the underlying treasury bill investment is unaffected in a repurchase accord reuter   baker says he stands by paris currency agreement treasury secretary james baker said he stood by the paris agreement among leading industrial nations to foster exchange rate stability around current levels i would refer you to the paris agreement which was a recognition the currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals baker told the cable news network in an interview we were quite satisfied with the agreement in paris otherwise we would not have been a party too it he said baker also noted the nations agreed in the accord to co operate to foster greater exchange rate stability around those levels he refused to comment directly on the current yen dollar rate but said flatly that foreign exchange markets recently tended to draw unwarranted inferences from what i say baker was quoted on british television over the weekend as saying he has no target for the u s currency a statement that triggered this week s renewed decline of the dollar i think the paris agreement represents evidence that international economic policy co ordination is alive and well baker said the treasury secretary stressed however it was very important for the main surplus countries to grow as fast as they could consistent with low inflation to resolve imbalances he added that federal reserve board chairman paul volcker has also been very outspoken in suggesting main trading partners grow as fast as they can baker noted that the j curve the delayed beneficial effect of a weakening of a currency on that country s balance takes to months to work its way through to the deficit and it is now months since the plaza agreement to lower the dollar s value he also said improvements in the deficit should come from other sources besides the exchange rate and pointed out the administration s package to improve u s competitiveness was now before congress reuter   baker says u s wants to stabilize exchange rates treasury secretary james baker said the united states and other nations were willing to cooperate to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the levels that existed at the time of an international agreement last month our position with respect to the dollar goes back to the paris agreement that the currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic conditions baker told a senate committee baker continued we said further that we and others are willing to cooperate closely to foster stability in exchange rates around those levels he referred to a february agreement by six leading industrial nations to cooperate on monetary matters baker refused to answer a question whether japan and germany had done enough to stimulate their domestic economies for the united states to support the dollar i will not comment because the foreign exchange market reads more or less than is intended in my statements baker said baker said that the other signatories recognized that they must carry their share of the load of correcting external imbalances that have hindered the world s economy he cited news reports that germany would increase a proposed tax cut for by about five billion marks to stimulate domestic growth japan also agreed to consider stimulative measures after the japanese budget was made final baker said those nations were stimulating their economies in a manner consistent with gains against inflation reuter   baker says u s willing to cooperate to stabilize exchange rates   baldrige says changes needed in exchange rates of currencies pegged to dollar   bangemann calls for currency calm west german economics minister martin bangemann urged a halt to the talking down of the dollar by both official and private institutions in the u s saying calm was needed on the foreign exchanges speaking at the opening of the th hanover industry fair bangemann said radical changes in foreign exchange parities had left their mark on exports and investments he added that without these external difficulties west germany s economy would have grown by pct last year instead of the pct reported bangemann said he could not deny that the economic climate in west germany had cooled but he stressed the country was not in a downtrend the minister also criticised state subsidies which he said mainly favoured large companies and created a tax burden for smaller and medium sized firms bangemann referred specifically to subsidies in the steel industry which he said had to be fought with all legal means when they did not correspond to european community guidelines on grants he added that in light of the declining demand for steel capacities had to be adjusted saying the bonn government would not successfully be able to stand in the way of any change in this industry bangemann also spoke out against protectionism and called for more competition citing as an example the federal post office the post office enjoys a monopoly in west germany especially as far as deciding who is able to provide
