have shied away from the notion of a free arrangement fearing to be overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer association with a country times their size in population but at the same time it added canadians realized their domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an increasingly competitive world the

themselves from nakasone uchida said his position within the ldp itself is not so strongly established today nakasone who has been more popular with the general public than with many ldp members is now seeing his public support eroded the analysts said the yen s rise to record highs and the u s threat on friday to impose tariffs on japanese electronics goods in retaliation for japan s alleged

give nakasone some nice present to take to washington on smouldering issues he will face a very hostile audience said merrill lynch securities economist william sterling if the trip is a major disaster it would seem to put the final nail in his coffin he said reagan s own weakened domestic position and growing republican as well as democratic anger with japan argue against a quick settlement to the dispute the analysts said but a desire on both sides to find some solution coupled with uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors to nakasone could still lead to an attempt to paper over the differences and aid nakasone they said one factor against a war may be that washington is not anxious to push nakasone into his grave sterling said reuter    s ready for

question said richard o brien economist at american express international bank in london japan s surplus billion dlrs last year has poured into share and bond markets around the world and funded a good chunk of the huge u s budget deficit around a third of any new sale of u s treasury bonds has been bought by the japanese however japanese investors have lost money as the dollar falls and will lose more if the united states lets it fall further to cut the deficit the counterpart of improving the deficit either through a lower dollar or because the u s increases duties on japanese electronic goods may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget deficit and if the u s deficit does fall the japanese will have less money to invest to entice u s investors to fill the gap that would be left if the japanese stopped buying u s bonds rates would have to soar o brien said the subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls on the world stock markets a year ago we could be pretty confident about the markets said o brien now it is much less certain buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming economy but the world economy with sluggish growth at best
