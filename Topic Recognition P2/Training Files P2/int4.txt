reuter   french week t bill average rate falls to pct from pct official   german banks see low rates continuing the association of german cooperative banks said in a financial survey that domestic rates would continue to remain low for the time being it said the bundesbank could hold them down despite strong foreign influence and it saw no straining factors in the economy that could affect the long term capital market the inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion for higher nominal rates but a probable rise in inflation late this year could give very slight grounds for a rise in nominal rates at year s end and next year it said the association said generally low rates prospects of lower taxes a stable dollar rate and expected strong domestic demand led it to believe that the investment climate would remain friendly and the economy would continue its slow but very sure growth the bundesbank had managed successfully to keep rates down on the short term money market although its policies had exerted little effect on the long term capital market which was so important for investment financing and thus for the course of the economy it said in view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policy had in influencing the longer term capital market the association saw little sense in wanting to boost the economy through a short term and expansionist monetary policy on the other hand it also saw no reason for sticking dogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of the association said time would show to what extent speculative foreign money and short term invested domestic money would distort money supply developments the bundesbank could hold down money market rates with the highly effective instrument of sale and repurchase transactions it said reuter   german bond yields seen falling in near term west german bond yields could decline over the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize exchange rates as seen in last month s paris pact extend to keeping down european rates banking economists said but in the longer term domestic yields could rise under agreements to stimulate west germany s economy they said the paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized currencies with the threat of central bank intervention economists said economists speculated that g countries may try to bolster the pact by uncoupling u s and west german rates further when they meet for the imf interim committee in april the recent round of monetary accommodation by the bundesbank and the bank of japan and the firming of the federal funds rate are significant they mark an uncoupling of movements in u s and foreign rates salomon bros inc said in a recent study it said narrowing of international rate spreads was a major factor in the dollar s fall these spreads will have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized west german bundesbank president karl otto poehl encouraged the u s not to cut rates in january when the bundesbank cut its own rates by half a point to avoid weakening the dollar west german economists see room for further cuts in leading west german rates if the dollar resumes its decline it s not a taboo peter pietsch spokesman for commerzbank ag said but most economists see room for a cut in west german rates only in the first half of the year as re emerging inflation will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year the bundesbank s average yield of public paper is already nearing last year s low last week yields fell to around pct not far from the low of pct posted in mid april economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to shift some funds from short to longer term paper such a move would tend to flatten the yield curve between short and long term rates which has become more pronounced since the bundesbank lowered its discount rate it might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates as the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow growth of the bundesbank s central bank money stock aggregate but conflicting with this trend are plans to increase west german tax cuts part of the paris currency pact designed to meet u s demands for faster west german growth this move may force rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must be filled by higher government borrowing this may not occur if private sector demand for credit remains weak but demand could emerge if rates begin rising economists said it appeared the government had already stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from other sources including tax losses resulting from weaker than expected economic growth and higher than expected spending josef koerner chief economist of the west german ifo institut said in a newspaper interview he expected tax revenue to be some billion marks below estimates by the west german government in november any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up but coupled with other factors such as waning foreign speculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar s decline long term yields may to have to rise economists said public authority borrowing in may also rise owing to increases in the second phase of bonn s tax reform package the west german government is raising its total tax cuts in by billion marks to billion west german chancellor helmut kohl said last week increased borrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable finance minister gerhard stoltenberg said last thursday he was looking for other ways to finance the reform such as raising indirect taxes but few economists believe the government will be able to go through with its tax measures without increasing net borrowing the bundesbank said in its february report that it was wrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in could be managed without increasing deficits the bundesbank said west german public authorities borrowed a large billion marks in credit markets in the final quarter compared with billion in fourth quarter the federal government took up nearly billion marks of the fourth quarter figures and also drew on two billion marks of bundesbank advances at the end of the year when it had not required such a credit in the quarter reuter   german government needs seen raising bond yields increased federal government borrowing needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy mark assets could push yields in german public authority bonds higher this year bond market sources say at the moment we have a sideways movement in the short term rates but how rates move in the long end will depend strongly on foreigners one portfolio manager for a large securities investment house in frankfurt said the sources also said the government had already stepped up its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs friday s loan stock was the third this year already the sources noted it carried a year maturity a coupon of six pct and price of to yield pct at issue this compared with the last issue which had a pct coupon priced at pct for a yield of pct but dealers said the terms were not enough to attract foreign investors and the federal government would have to push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon sources noted federal government issues had also increased in size with the introduction of a four billion mark volume only starting last may one finance ministry economist said it isn t more it s just the size of each bond which has increased he added conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly favourable for raising new debt until recently federal issues sold very strongly abroad with up to pct of some being placed with foreign investors with the recent stabilisation of the u s dollar however foreign investors have begun to back away from the market as hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish sources said the government has may have already stepped up its borrowing having raised more than billion marks the government made net borrowings of billion marks in but bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing through bonds was billion the sources said this indicated a move by the government out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds through the more acceptable loan stock form although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large amount of issues maturing recently other factors including the government s tax reduction program would also reduce income next year the problem here will be the tax reform the portfolio manager said he added that the government s cut in its top income tax rate to pct from pct in would make it difficult for the government to reduce borrowings the sources said the government would fall far short of covering all of its billion marks in lost revenue from the tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to fall back on debt markets in one form or the other the portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal government loan stocks so far this year it has also fallen back twice to raise a total billion marks through the issue of fixed rate medium term kassenobligation notes a finance ministry economist said the government did not expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a net billion marks this year though many sources agreed they added that the trend would probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come into effect i would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would mean government borrowing will increase the manager said bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance with the bundesbank s public authority bond yield calculation falling to pct on friday from a week earlier but sources said foreign demand for the new federal government loan stock was slack as sentiment grows that the dollar may now rise against the mark the demand wasn t so good a dealer for a german bank in london said the dollar s recent slight appreciation against the mark even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds recently some dealers said reuter   gm s gm pontiac has rate incentives general motors corp said its pontiac division has established an rate
