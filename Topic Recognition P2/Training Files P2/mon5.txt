 encouraged the market to challenge the authorities despite concerted intervention by the central banks of the united states japan britain and west germany they said pleas by japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa for action to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend by comments by u s treasury secretary james baker that there was no target zone for the dollar the dollar was sold anyway yesterday s comment by baker that he stood by the paris accord did nothing to reverse sentiment dealers said the intervention backed by remarks by fed chairman paul volcker and japanese central bank governor satoshi sumita which a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to a halt has done little but slow the rate of its decline they noted the situation has again raised the question of whether intervention can succeed against the trend in today s huge currency markets dealers said the market s cool response to intervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars this means that the current dollar selling is not of a sheer speculative nature but backed by real demand said koichi miyazaki deputy general manager at sanwa bank dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite the intervention and it is only a matter of time before some operators try to push it below yen the dollar closed in tokyo today at against new york s its record low was in tokyo last tuesday dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support to rise above yen toward early april when the group of seven industrial nations meets to discuss currencies again the market expects the seven nations the paris six plus italy to try to agree on another way to stabilise currencies apart from intervention a chief dealer at a u s bank said dealers said they were unsure what other methods could be used and they are sceptical anyway about how long the paris accord nations particulary the u s will remain willing to prevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high u s deficit especially with japan further pressure from a protectionist u s congress for a lower dollar is also limiting washington s options they said the market now thinks the central bank action is to slow the dollar fall not to push it back over yen said tadahiko nashimoto manager at long term credit bank of japan another bearish factor for the dollar is expected large forward dollar sales from april to june for export bills falling due for japanese exporters from april to september the exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yen depreciation dealers said yesterday s request to trading houses by the ministry of international and industry to restrict dollar sales looks ineffective in light of this real demand they said the market is also anticipating active institutional dollar sales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the new business year starting april dealers said the market seems to have established a new dollar trading range between and yen one dealer said the dollar  d between and yen after the paris accord on february and yen was then considered the low end for the dollar against the yen he said some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below yen it will pick up renewed

said the paris agreement among leading industrial nations is intended to produce reasonable stability in exchange markets over the next few months he told a senate banking subcommittee the group of five nations and canada agreed in paris to see if there can t be a period of reasonable stability instead of volatility to give time for the committments in paris to take place asked by sen phil gramm r tex whether u s intervention was not in fact overvaluing the dollar mulford replied that the administration judged that after economic adjustments current exchange rates reflect underlying economic fundamentals in particular the stability sought by the nations would allow west germany and japan to stimulate their economies domestically and the u s to cut its budget deficit mulford said in his testimony he stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar would hurt the ability of germany and japan to boost growth mulford noted that half of west germany s economy was affected by international developments he also said increased japanese domestic growth would result in more u s exports to japan and would not necessarily lead to greater japanese capital flows to the u s as gramm asserted if japan reformed its domestic capital market commenting on the paris agreement mulford said i think exchange rates ought to be stabilized so germany s and japan s efforts can be carried out mulford rejected gramm s argument that faster domestic growth in germany and japan would result in an even lower dollar mulford said the administration wanted to achieve a pattern of higher growth overseas as a way of improving the u s deficit otherwise he said the deficit would be resolved either through a much lower dollar or a u s recession both alternatives he termed unacceptable and undesirable reuter   nigeria changes auction rules to defend naira nigeria s central bank has changed the rules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analysts see as a means of defending the naira currency which has depreciated steadily the bank said in a statement that from april banks bidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they offered and not as

for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they offered and not as presently at the rate of the lowest successful bid made at the auction this should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure that they were successful while paying the lower marginal rate analysts said it should act as a brake because banks will know that if they bid high they will have to pay what they offered a western diplomat commented the naira has depreciated against the dollar by pct since the auctions known as the second tier foreign exchange market sfem began last september at last week s session the nigerian currency was fixed at to the dollar the third fall in a row they were clearly worried and this is the logical way of trying to stop the trend the diplomat said the central bank also announced the auctions would be fortnightly not weekly beginning on april it was not immediately clear whether next thursday s scheduled session would still take place nor if the bank was planning to double the mln dlrs which are normally on offer at each auction demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstripped supply encouraging banks to bid high and thus further weakening the naira if the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at the fortnightly session high demand could undermine the objective of the new system analysts said although bidding banks will now pay what they offered the official exchange rate for the naira applying to business transactions will continue to be the marginal rate the lowest successful bid sfem is a central part of nigeria s structural adjustment program which is considered to be the most ambitious economic recovery plan in black africa the program involves setting a realistic exchange rate for the naira which was over valued for many years liberalising imports boosting agriculture removing subsidies and reducing inefficient government participation in the economy the world bank has played a prominent part in designing this dramatic blue print and in selling it to an often sceptical public which fears inflation and lower living standards ishrat husain the world bank s representative in nigeria said yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustment program as a whole and the foreign exchange auctions so far so good he told a meeting of bankers in lagos adding that only members of nigeria s import dependent elite would suffer hard

banks were disqualified from bidding at today s weekly foreign exchange auction the central bank said the naira finished at to the dollar against last week only mln dlrs of the mln dlrs on offer was sold with all bidding banks successfully obtaining hard currency the effective rate including a central bank levy for transactions in the coming week was against last week the failure to sell the whole allocation was due to the central bank s unprecedented disqualification of banks as punishment for inadequate documentation in previous transactions banks are required to submit proof that their bids are based on valid commercial transactions and the central bank has complained in the past that many are failing to produce the right paperwork within the specified time reuter   no zimbabwe dollar devaluation central bank zimbabwe s reserve bank the nation s central bank has denied the zimbabwe dollar would be devalued bank governor kombo moyana told the herald daily newspaper unfortunate and completely unfounded speculation that a depreciation of the zimbabwe dollar was about to occur had aggravated a serious foreign exchange shortage during february and the early part of march this speculation caused importers to bring forward their payments and exporters to delay as long as possible the inward remittance of export receipts resulting in a significant slowdown in net

assist the lebanese pound which has lost more than pct of its value against the dollar since january bouldikian told an arab exchange dealers conference the bank would continue to take measures to defend the currency but he said lebanon needed foreign support for its war battered economy now more than ever before we expect a common effort between the central bank and arab central banks and monetary authorities to create an arab fund to support and preserve the value of the currency when needed he said twelve years of civil war have devastated productive sectors of the lebanese economy and created gaping and budget deficits bouldikian said recent government measures had succeeded in reducing demand for imports and increasing exports these are encouraging factors but the war has not ended yet he said we believe that with a just political solution acceptable to all sides confidence will return and this will benefit the lebanese pound and lebanon in the meantime he said the central bank had four main goals to use surplus liquidity to finance the budget deficit to increase the role of commercial banks and non bank financing institutions in financing the deficit to limit the

particular importance to the consensus which was reached in paris the minister nevertheless added that he would make clear during his trip to washington that west germany s nominal figures gave a false impression about actual flows stoltenberg noted that in bonn s exports fell by a nominal two pct while its nominal imports fell by pct west germany s imports dropped largely because of foreign currency developments and the cheaper price of oil and led to a record surplus last year however stoltenberg said that in real terms west germany s exports by volume had increased by pct while real imports had risen by a much stronger pct in this way west germany had made its contribution to economic stability stoltenberg added stoltenberg noted the government expected imports to rise by a real four to five pct in with exports stagnating he said it was too early to revise official forecasts for west germany s economic growth this year the government has forecast an unchanged pct rise in

corporation said omer made the remarks after a meeting in khartoum yesterday with imf envoy abdel shakour shaalan sudan burdened by a foreign debt of billion dlrs is some mln dlrs in arrears to the

the u s currency since then it has resisted pressure from main creditors for more currency adjustments arguing that past devaluations had failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollar for foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers dealers in khartoum s thriving black market said the dollar was sold at pounds today with stringent import regulations and the government increasingly short of foreign currency black market dollars are used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouring countries mainly egypt kenya ethiopia and zaire western diplomats in khartoum say the meetings between imf and sudanese government officials do not amount to formal talks but rather an effort by the imf to monitor sudan s economic performance the diplomats said sudan hoped a planned four year economic recovery program would be acceptable to the imf as a serious attempt to tackle the country s economic troubles and persuade its gulf arab creditors to pay the imf arrears this they said could provide sudan with a clean bill of health from the imf that it could take to western government creditors grouped informally in the so called paris club to reschedule debt payments twenty three pct of sudan s total foreign debt is owed to members of the paris club the diplomats said sudan s finance minister said last month the country s imf representative had told him the fund s executive board was very pleased with the mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the past couple of months the representative omer said said imf managing director michel camdessus said he would ask saudi arabia to which sudan owes about billion dlrs to help khartoum to pay more sudan has an annual debt liability of nearly mln dlrs but
