iraq abu al bukhoosh was producing barrels per day bpd at the time of the attack but the sources said it would resume at a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff and the fact only four of five wellheads were now operable the sources said only personnel can be housed in remaining accomodations the sources said facilities being installed to protect the field include aircraft detection equipment anti aircraft missiles housing for military personnel and helicopter landing pads the sources said abu dhabi is the largest oil producer in the united arab emirates accounting for about bpd

within the industry on how to stimulate energy production but there is consensus on removing several government policies that hinder investments in new prospects dibona said the windfall profit tax should be abolished immediately and current proposals for increased environmental regulations on acid rain and waste disposal should be not adopted he also suggested that the arctic national wildlife refuge in alaska should be opened up for leasing to oil companies dibona said this is a battle the industry cannot afford to lose if the nation is to continue to benefit from alaskan oil dibona said

australia said to rely too much on oil taxes the government s over reliance on revenue from oil is adversely affecting australia s economic performance australian petroleum exploration association apea chairman dennis benbow said over one third of australia s indirect tax income is derived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak prices he told the apea annual conference here this dependence on oil generated revenue distorts the country s economic performance directly by acting as a disincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting trading competitiveness through high energy costs he said australia s medium term liquid fuel self sufficiency position is posing a major economic threat yet the government s response has been to load new tax burdens on the oil industry benbow said domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to fall to barrels per day bpd in fiscal from bpd in reflecting mainly the decline of the bass strait fields he said bass strait reserves are now two thirds depleted with the three largest fields pct depleted he said by bass strait output is expected to be just over half the level assuming a number of so far undeveloped fields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from existing fields goes ahead benbow said government projections of output from as yet undiscovered fields range from to bpd he said australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to bpd in from in implying a oil gap of between and bpd in five years time he said at present world oil prices and the current value of the australian dollar annual oil imports in would cost between billion and billion dlrs benbow said despite intensive exploration in the early s the addition to reserves has been inadequate he said for example the mln barrels discovered in the five years represent about two years consumption he said he called on the government to review its tax policies to restore incentive to exploration reuter   australian minister sees targeted oil tax strategy australia s oil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of a targeted rather than broadly based approach federal resources and energy minister gareth evans told a meeting here he told the australian petroleum exploration association apea annual conference there was a prospect of developing a package that would recognise the government s economic priorities while also meeting some of the industry s concerns evans was referring to a nearly completed government review of oil taxation evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results in recent years these include the reduction in the top marginal excise rate on old bass strait oil found before september to pct from pct and the waiver of excise on onshore oil announced last september he said the industry through the apea has been calling for the elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost incentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices and australia s relatively low exploration levels while nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to an already complex taxation regime i am inclined to favour these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes which leave government revenue much reduced and may still leave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are going to do in major areas evans said he said the government did not intend to change its resource rent taxation rrt legislation now before parliament in response to industry calls to allow all exploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible as previously reported rrt is a tax of pct limited to highly prospective offshore areas based on profits after a certain rate of return has been achieved for individual projects apea has said it is not a true profit based tax because exploration deductibility is limited to successful projects evans said the decision not to change rrt was based more than anything on the government s desire to ensure the certainty and stability of the new regime adding that major investments have already been planned on the existing ground rules reuter   australian oil industry to continue tax campaign the council of the australian petroleum exploration association apea said it will press on with its campaign for major improvements to australia s petroleum taxation structure the council said in a statement the industry was bitterly disappointed by the australian government s position on taxation as presented in a speech by resources and energy minister gareth evans to the apea conference as earlier reported evans said he was inclined to target any tax changes rather than take a broad based approach to secondary taxation of petroleum apea had expected the government to make positive responses to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and development the council said it said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by evans but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed with the current resource rental tax rrt legislation evans told the conference the government did not plan to accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure the government s unwillingness to allow the deduction of unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore area in which rrt applies negates any claim that the tax is profit based the apea council said the government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the industry s concerns despite its recognition of the industry s problems the council said the industry has called for the end of all discriminatory secondary taxation of petroleum citing them as major disincentives at a time of low oil prices reuter   australian oil tax cut seen boosting output a percentage point reduction in the australian government s maximum oil levy on old oil would stabilize bass straits oil output resources analyst ian story said here a reduction to pct from pct would enable bass strait output to be maintained at the current rate of barrels per day bpd for the next year rather than falling to bpd in he told the australian petroleum exploration association annual conference story is an analyst with and a director of sydney stockbroker meares and philips ltd windfall profits taxes on bass strait are no longer appropriate in the current economic climate story said the maximum pct levy on old oil that discovered before september is now forcing the broken hill pty co ltd brkn s exxon corp xon partner  to shut in production accelerating the decline in output and reducing government revenue he said he said the producer return per barrel at a price of australian dlrs a barrel would rise to dlrs from dlrs if the levy was cut to pct the economics at an pct levy are simply not attractive at oil prices below dlrs story said cutting the maximum levy rate to pct would create higher levels of self sufficiency increase government revenue boost exports and provide incentives for exploration

were likely to reach billion dlrs this year from billion in the gcc groups bahrain kuwait oman qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emirates uae the bank said the improvement would result from higher oil prices made possible by last december s opec accord to restrain overall group production these curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight dollars a barrel in mid to around dlrs all signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in the economies of these gcc countries although this expected growth will not be similar to that of the s boom years the study said it added
