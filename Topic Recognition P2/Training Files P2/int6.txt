minutes today of a bank of england one billion stg tap issue the second such issue in as many weeks analysts noted they said the near instant sale of the entire new gilts issue for which the bank of england had required a high pct downpayment was clear evidence that the market thought rates had to drop sooner rather than later the sale of the tranche of pct treasury bonds due occurred in an active bullish gilts market as downward pressure on money market rates remained intact with the bellwether three month interbank rate down point at pct it coincided with another strong sterling rally which pushed the pound to four year highs against the dollar that government stock disappeared very quickly indeed said stephen lewis head of economic research at stockbrokers phillips and drew it is an indication that the market believes rates are going to fall further at least by a half point immediately after the budget on march and some people hope for more stockbrokers james capel said in a comment the move by the national savings department was of considerable significance it said the real message is that the decks are being quickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by the building societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cut in bank base rates to pct materialises building societies have said a drop in bank base rates would normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to a reduction in mortgage lending rates lewis of phillips and drew said he too believed the national savings issue suspension may reflect new u k treasury policy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut national savings has been competing too effectively with the building societies of late building society income has been depressed in recent months he said he and other analysts said chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lid on u k inflation underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in britain than in most other western economies with inflation seen rising well above four pct this year and above five pct in after last year s pct emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumer prices lewis said a one point cut in building society rates would reduce inflation in britain by about pct but lewis and others noted that building societies had been complaining to the government about intense competition from national savings which they argued reduced the scope for early mortgage rate cuts the chancellor need not be worried about losing some psbr funding from national savings but he must be taking the building societies criticism to heart it looks like the national savings move reflects this one senior dealer said a savings department spokesman refused to comment on this interpretation saying the suspension of the issue was merely a reaction to the recent fall in u k rates which had pushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line with the rest of the market we are not politically motivated funding was just becoming too expensive and we don t need all that money he told reuters adding the department had suspended issues at least twice in the past when offered rates were above or below market rates he said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late as u k money market rates continued their steady decline and income was threatening to overshoot
