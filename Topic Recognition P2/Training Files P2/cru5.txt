not renewing iran term contracts most japanese companies have decided not to renew term contracts to lift iranian oil because spot prices remain considerably lower than opec s official levels industry sources said they said a cargo of the mideast benchmark dubai  d yesterday at dlrs a barrel compared to its official price of dlrs only one japanese company has renewed its term contract for iranian oil for the second quarter the sources said the sources said japanese companies had been lifting a total of about barrels per day bpd of iranian under term contracts but only one firm has agreed to lift in the second quarter it is lifting just to bpd they said this move could inspire iran to offer discounts on cargoes loading in april but the likelihood of discounts depended largely on the levels of spot prices if the spot price of dubai goes above dlrs we would probably buy iranian at the official price one japanese refiner said we don t intend to put pressure on them he added buyers

problem finding opec to purchase at the official prices qatar has chartered floating storage for its oil after finding no buyers at official prices in march the problem is likely to recur in april adding to that country s surplus the  rs added that iraq had dissociated itself from opec s december production agreement while agreeing to the fixed prices but oil analysts said if opec keeps group output close to its first half ceiling of mln bpd supply and demand would be balanced by the end of the second quarter they also said if opec holds its official price structure based on a reference

of saudi arabia s determined effort to support prices analysts said the saudis and other opec nations are jawboning the market hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without another meeting said sanford margoshes oil analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc but opec is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating he added oil industry analysts said saudi arabia has led the attempt to get other opec members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december the analysts said that to get others to hold the line saudi arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the gulf cooperation council last weekend and at the cooperation council oil ministers meeting the previous week the saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil analysts said they are trying to make sure that no one discounts and to prevent that it appears that saudi arabia or some other opec member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales margoshes said he added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like qatar which has had trouble selling oil but it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts analysts said that saudi arabia with assistance from opec president rilwanu lukman was trying to avoid an emergency opec meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the december pact is falling apart daniel mckinley oil analyst with smith barney upham harris and co said both physical and futures markets have been oversold and it only took a

production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level the production probably is about their quota level and largely because saudi arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as a result margoshes said analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally some believe prices can continue to rise if saudi arabia and opec hold steady in a refusal to discount but others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors including demand which could cut the rally short marion stewart an indepedent petroleum economist said slow growth

analysts opec may be forced to meet before a scheduled june session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices oil industry analysts said the movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as opec thought they may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems said daniel yergin director of cambridge energy research associates cera analysts and oil industry sources said the problem opec faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets opec s problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way said paul mlotok oil analyst with salomon brothers inc he said the market s earlier optimism about opec and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices but some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of opec production above the mln bpd quota set last december opec has to l  that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas fixed prices and set differentials said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named the market is now trying to teach them that lesson again he added david t mizrahi editor of mideast reports expects opec to meet before june although not immediately however he is not optimistic that opec can address its principal problems they will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil but in late march and april when demand slackens mizrahi said but mizrahi said that opec is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at mln bpd analysts said that the next two months will be critical for opec s ability to hold together prices and output opec must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then said dillard spriggs of petroleum analysis ltd in new york but bijan moussavar rahmani of harvard university s energy and environment policy center said that the demand for opec oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production demand for their opec oil is clearly above mln bpd and is probably closer to mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is opec meeting this demand through current production he told reuters in a telephone interview reuter   opec president says output well below ceiling opec conference president rilwanu lukman said the group was producing well below the mln bpd ceiling it set in december partly because liftings had been delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed opec prices lukman during a brief visit to london on his way home from jamaica told reuters in a telephone interview that in february opec had underproduced partly because members were strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official prices of around dlrs a barrel we are determined to stand firm by the december accord he said i have spoken to every other opec minister and they are committed to making the accord work he said lukman gave no specific figures for february output he said the opec secretariat in vienna was finalizing these figures told of a reuters survey published today which estimated that opec output so far this week was below mln bpd he said that could well be correct opec s news agency opecna today issued a statement saying group output was well below its ceiling in february but it gave no figures but one source close to opec indicated that february output may have been between and mln bpd the reuter survey estimated opec february output at around mln bpd opec agreed in december to cut output by pct to mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting february lukman said qatar nigeria saudi arabia and iran had all produced in february below their opec quotas iraq which said it would not honour its mln bpd quota under the december pact had produced less than had been anticipated he said lukman said that some industry reports may be correct that in february nigeria propuced bpd below its mln bpd quota saudi arabia bpd less than its mln allocation and qatar to pct under its bpd quota he said that sweet  s such as those produced by his country were coming under price pressure because they were currently officially priced above sweet north sea grades and the united states west texas intermediate wti however he said opec in december had anticipated that demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks we have to be patient for two or three weeks the market is now firming on actual fundamentals he said adding that he expected it to go up and up even beyond official prices after early april this is when traditionally there is more demand for gasoline rich  s such as nigeria s the opec president said producers such as kuwait venezuela and indonesia were having less problems with output than producers like his own country because they exported oil products also some of venezuela s heavy grades were outside the opec pricing system he said lukman said that if refiner buyers now refusing to lift some opec oil at official prices instead used their own stocks and ran them down to dangerous levels they would eventually have to buy opec oil when they realise it is not a free for all in the market they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more later on he said lukman asked about industry reports that nigeria was being pressured by equity producers for better terms said it was important to know that terms with them were negotiable flexible and under constant review not only when the market seemed weak he said that so far no meeting of the seven nation ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that such a meeting now twice postponed was not a high priority for opec at the moment at this time we have to get our priorities right he said the most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is working not dealing with a differential of cents between grades but if any opec member raised concerns or objections over the differential system a meeting would be called he said reuter   opec reaffirms commitment to fixed prices ceiling opec has reaffirmed its commitment to fixed oil prices of around dlrs a barrel and an overall output ceiling of mln barrels per day bpd to defend prices its president rilwanu lukman said he told a news conference here after due consultation with my colleagues in opec i hereby wish to emphasize that nigeria and all member countries of opec remain determined to uphold the december agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices lukman added no extraordinary opec conference was planned we are in a position to re confirm that despite misleading news in foreign media to the contrary opec member countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the month of february lukman who is nigerian oil minister said lukman put the overall opec output shortfall in february at bpd and said this was as a result of their firm determination to defend official selling prices of dlrs agreed upon last december in geneva the december agreement set an overall output ceiling for opec of mln bpd for first half and restored fixed prices as from february around a reference point of dlrs oil prices rallied immediately after the geneva accord but fell again last month on reports that opec was producing more than the agreed level the idea was to suggest that opec s agreement would not hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of opec oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs lukman said he said the bpd shortfall last february was based on the verified figure for out of opec s members adding that nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of bpd iraq disassociated itself from the december agreement while the production figures of ecuador and the united arab emirates needed to be verified lukman said if that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement succeed we are ready opec is not changing its price level of dlrs the group s president said he said the opec price differentials committee meeting formerly postponed to april had been put off indefinitely furthermore no extraordinary meeting of the conference is at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in december are being adhered to he said asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow the gaps in the prices of the various opec  s fixed in relation to the dlr benchmark lukman replied we consider the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials lukman said opec was aware that consumers had heavily drawn on stocks of both oil and refined products to levels well below this time last year and soon they would return to the market in search of we don t see that there is going to be any difficulty in maintaining the dlr price throughout the rest of the year lukman said the opec president praised non opec oil producers which he said had contributed to the group s efforts to stabilise prices but he criticised britain for maintaining its long held view not to do anything to help the market we are quite confident however that in the long term with two thirds of the world s reserves in opec hands the future is ours we will use that advantage responsibly he said lukman described the disruption in ecuador s output following an earthquake as tragic but refused to say if the south american country would be allowed a higher output quota when it recovered from the disaster reuter   opec says february output under ceiling opec output in february was well below the mln bpd ceiling it set in december and all countries are strictly adhering to their quotas the opec news agency opecna quoted an opec secretariat official as saying the official was quoted as saying that lower output was the result of member countries firm determination to defend the organisation s official price of dlrs per barrel and to refrain from selling any quantity below that price the unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no opec meeting was foreseen before the next biannual opec session planned to start on june the official gave no figure for february output the statement said only that the reduction in total supplies namely actual exports of oil and products plus local deliveries in member countries is even more pronounced as those supplies fell very noticeably during that month no matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters to align the official selling price to the ongoing market price member countries are without exception strictly adhering to the official selling price in spite of the financial hard  this may entail the statement said the very recent improvement in the price structure is an indicator of such determination by the organization to stick to the official selling price the statement said free spot market prices rose from around dlrs a barrel in early december last year to near opec s official levels towards the end of the year after the opec pact there has been oil industry speculation that opec might have to hold an extraordinrary meeting prior to its scheduled june session to discuss reports of overproduction by some states and strains on the differential
