d swap third world debt paper for so called exit bonds for banks like regional american or european institutions such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled and has been suggested by argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of billion dlrs he emphasised that the megabank was not an administration plan but something some people have suggested other u s officials said japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume third world debt this plan actively under consideration would differ slightly from the one the official described but the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the united states if the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go fine i don t think they ever will he pointed out that banks would swap their third world loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution meanwhile the official praised the philippine plan under which it would make payments on its debt in cash at no more than pct above libor the philippine proposal is very  ing it s quite unique and i don t think it s something that should be categorically rejected out of hand the official said banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of philippine investment notes these  able dollar denominated notes would have a six year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity the country would guarantee a payment of point over libor until now bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low the talks now in their second week are aimed at stretching out repayments of billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on billion of already rescheduled debt the country which has enjoyed strong political support in washington since corazon aquino came to power early last year owes an overall billion dlrs of debt but the official denied the plan amounts to rate capitalisation a development until now unacceptable to the banks it s no more rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over libor from what existed before the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek some people argue that cutting the spread is debt forgiveness what it really is is narrowing the spread on new money he added he said the u s debt strategy is sufficiently broad

out of their narrow ranges and low volatility during the remainder of the week we got a little volatility wednesday said staley commodities international analyst jerome lacey but for the moment we re still in a trading range even unexpected developments concerning the growth of the u s economy may not be enough to spur the market out of its sluggish state the analysts said it the bond market has not yet demonstrated that it can break out of its very low volatility said carroll mcentee and mcginley analyst denis karnosky it needs something but it s not going to be news about the economy he said karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break out of the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar has stabilized and the federal reserve has more room to conduct monetary policy but even wednesday when fed funds were below six pct the dollar strong and oil on the soft side bond futures attracted eager sellers when contracts approached recent highs he said in addition to a changing perception about the dollar and monetary policy golden gate futures president norman quinn said the beginning of april could bring foreign investors back into the marketplace the market is beginning to feel there may be demand at the beginning of the fiscal year in japan on april quinn said quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there are large amounts of cash waiting to be invested if japanese investment in u s securities does materialize at the start of japan s fiscal year domestic funds may also flow into the bond market he said we could get a stiff rally possibly enough to bring yields on long bonds down to seven to pct compared to the current yield of about pct quinn said in the meantime even the prospect of new supply is not likely to move futures the

other sources one economist at the german banking association said but the volume of savings funds may not be substantially undercut by lower savings rates because many customers are parking funds in

weight of opinion is that in a year from now there is a higher probability there will be one pct higher than one pct lower rates he said the world bank had not issued floating rate notes so far this

said cash in hand was now about pct of the next three years anticipated net requirement and comprised pct of outstanding debt and pct of its debt maturing within five years although the world bank had pioneered the swap market it did not intend to launch new financial instruments just for the sake of innovation rotberg said of a total of billion dlrs debt outstanding only some eight billion had been swapped into another currency many recent innovations were either unfair to investors or unfair to borrowers until the world bank was confident that this was not the case it would not adopt new instruments the world bank would raise pct of the funds needed over the next year with methods used before rotberg said however for some pct of new requirements the bank would try out new instruments such as bonds with warrants the world bank had publicly offered bonds in germany since the first issue was launched in he said
