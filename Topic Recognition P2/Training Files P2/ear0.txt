quoted in frankfurt and dusseldorf in may van driel said van driel stressed that while these listings would not be accompanied by new share issues they provided easy vehicles for the company to raise capital for future expansion he estimated that pct of the company s shares were in foreign hands the company s us turnover of about mln dlrs made a listing on one of the new york exchanges a logical
