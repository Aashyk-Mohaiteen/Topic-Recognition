decree also set a mln dlr cap on how much funding the newly combined companies will have to spend on the disputed drilling bit business until it is sold an earlier proposed consent decree did not establish a funding limit the baker hughes merger which would would create a billion dlr oilfield services company almost fell through earlier this month when hughes balked at terms of a proposed justice department consent decree that would have given the companies only three months to find a buyer for the reed business baker said today it would withdraw the one billion dlr lawsuit it had filed to force hughes to follow through with the merger hughes kistler speaking to reporters after pct of hughes shareholders approved the merger said the revised terms of the agreement give the companies six months to find a buyer for the reed drilling bit business the previous agreement had proposed a three month period kistler said the the government had also indicated it would consider granting if necessary an additional three month extension to complete the sale he said there were several people looking at the domestic drilling bit business the companies kistler said have also decided to voluntarily sell a reed plant in singapore kistler estimated that the merger which should be completed in about two weeks will result in annual cost savings of about mln dlrs he said he expects substantial cutbacks in the member workforce at baker hughes inc the name the merged company will take kistler said the cost savings and greater efficiencies should put the company on a

securities and exchange monday reporting a stake of five pct or more in some publicly  d company he declined to identify the target other than to rule out hughes one analyst said another factor in the latest hughes turnabout was borg warner corp bor which owns pct of hughes borg warner ex chairman j f bere who serves on the hughes board is believed to favor the merger with baker despite the hughes statement that it is  ed in a merger and baker s response that a merger is still possibile analysts said no one could be certain where the situation was going i think the merger is not going through said phil pace analyst at kidder peabody and co he said the merger lost a lot of its appeal when the u s department of justice required that baker sell off its reed tool co operation although the reed operation is relatively small in view of the total size of a combined baker hughes pace said to pct of the cost savings are tied up in that they hughes are obviously concerned about the lawsuit said james crandell analyst at salomon brothers inc apparently they are willing to continue discussions but whether they will alter their position i don t know it s getting a little confusing said james carroll analyst at painewebber group inc he said the arguments cited by hughes yesterday for not doing the merger tend to be weak hughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger it wanted reed tool and other businesses sold prior to april the projected merger date a government decree allowed a longer period of time hughes contended it was better to formally combine the companies with the status of reed already settled baker apparently sees no reason to speed up the sale carroll said baker had previously estimated to mln dlrs in savings if the companies were combined without selling reed but he said baker now thinks to mln dlrs will be saved while hughes sees a saving of only to mln dlrs carroll also noted that since the merger accord was first signed the outlook for the industry

justice requirement that baker sell off several specialised subsidiaries in businesses related to oil drilling the hughes board last week indicated that it might cancel the merger because of the department of justice requirement the board of directors of the california based baker had approved the merger on february baker said it had signed an agreement to sell one of the subsidiaries the

service companies a previously adjourned meeting of hughes tool stockholders will be resumed this afternoon it said hughes will work with baker and the justice department towards negotiating the final form of the consent decree and filing it as soon as possible the company said in a statement closing of the merger would occur immediately after the filing it said the assets to be sold under the consent decree consist of baker s domestic oilfield drilling bit business and its domestic submersible electric pump business baker has an agreement to sell the pump business to trico industries inc

companies kistler said of the proposed merger that would result in a billion dlr oil field service company we re working very hard on this merger hughes board today again adjourned a shareholders meeting to vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for march to give baker more time to consider the counter proposal the hughes board which had previously expressed concern about a u s department of justice consent decree that would require baker to sell its drilling bit operations and submersible pump business met yesterday and threatened to terminate the proposed merger the hughes board made a counter proposal that the two companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses before signing the decree the directors of baker immediately after receiving the counter proposal filed a law suit in texas in a texas state court to force to hughes to complete the merger the uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might be imposed by the department of justice makes us very nervous about what the outcome might be kistler said in explaining why hughes had made the counter proposal we need additional time to understand why baker did not accept our proposal kistler also said that the law suit filed by baker was not a factor in the board s decision to keep its merger proposal on the table he declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit kistler said hughes would be willing to consider a compromise counter proposal but declined to be more specific the justice department in january said it would block the hughes and baker merger on anti trust grounds unless both companies agreed to sign a consent decree that would provide for the sale of the assets after the merger took place the hughes board said it would not sign the decree because its was too unreasonable hughes said that baker should instead complete the sale of the disputed assets before the merger is finalized and given government approval under the decree if baker is unable to find acceptable buyers within a specified period of time after the decree is approved a federal trustee would become responsible for finding a buyer kistler said that under those terms the trustee could take up to years to complete the sales he also expressed concern that the combined companies might be required by the government s conditions to license some of its technology to any purchaser of the assets baker said last night in a statement that the required assets to be sold would reduce revenues by about mln dlrs representing about three pct of the revenues of the combined companies
