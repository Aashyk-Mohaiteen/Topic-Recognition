umination of and confidence in u s dollar policy salomon brothers henry kaufman said the bond market highly sensitized to dollar movements could be encouraged if currency markets seem to be stabilizing or if u s and overseas economic growth is perceived as slowing sharply the crucial question however is how soon either of these developments is likely to occur kaufman said market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio manager confidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a while longer said philip braverman chief economist at irving securities corp however braverman said that from a longer term perspective current bond prices provide a buying opportunity despite a nearly one point bond price rebound friday on unexpectedly weak march employment data key year treasury bonds lost points in price for the week as a whole and thursday s pct closing yield was a high braverman said historical evidence suggests that a long bond yield in the pct area provides a basis for optimism bonds closed at pct on friday the irving economist noted that three times last year in a similar paroxysm of pessimism the key bonds reached a similar closing yield high within three to six weeks in each instance however braverman said bond prices recovered to bring the yield down sharply by to basis points mitchell held of smith barney harris upham and co inc said that many portfolio managers now believe yields could approach nine pct by midyear which he considers unlikely held said that since late smith barney analysts have spoken about the risk that rates could move higher and they continue to believe that an upward bias is likely to persist over the next few months held said that in conversations with portfolio managers last week there appeared to be increasing belief that the rate rise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct by midyear naturally that would mean a sharp bond price fall yields could rise further over the next few months but the rise should be less than the basis point rise we ve seen since the start of the year held said most expect fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term the fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance said economists at aubrey g lanston and co inc they said the fed cannot tighten policy and push up rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollar and head off renewed inflationary psychology that might harm the fragile u s economic expansion the lanston economists said the fed cannot ease its policy stance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calm domestic and third world debt jitters without the threat of causing a further decline in the dollar minutes of february s federal open market committee fomc meeting released friday showed that while the fomc left policy unchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policy later if conditions in the economy foreign exchange or credit markets warranted a policy shift however economists generally believe that continued fairly sluggish u s economic growth and the financial strains on u s banks resulting from their problem loans to developing countries rule out any fed policy firming there is broad agreement among economists that the fomc at last tuesday s meeting also left fed policy unchanged this week s u s economic data are expected to have little impact february consumer instalment credit numbers are due on wednesday with march producer price data out friday there may be mild relief in some quarters that the u s purchasing managers composite index a closely watched economic indicator rose only to pct in march from pct a friday rumor had put the number far higher the index s first quarter average also was pct translating into real gnp growth of about three pct if continued through federal funds  d at pct late friday and are expected to open about there today with no fed action seen reuter   u s credit market outlook mini refunding a hefty slice of new u s treasury supply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering credit market but at least this week s offerings should provide it with some focus economists said banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put to work so the auctions should breathe some life into the market said economists at merrill lynch capital markets inc the treasury will place a billion dlr package of two year four year and seven year notes on the sales block this week the mini refunding which will raise billion dlrs in new cash comprises billion dlrs of two year notes for auction on tuesday billion dlrs of four year notes on wednesday and billion dlrs of seven year notes on thursday the market also faces the regular weekly three and six month bill auction today amounting to billion dlrs the mini refunding does not come at a particularly auspicious time for the market bond prices have been drifting sideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudy u s economic outlook diminished chances of a change in federal reserve board policy and a stable dollar moreover the bond market s inertia has compared unfavourably with the rash of activity taking place in high yield markets overseas like the u k as well as in u s equities but according to the merrill lynch economists there are signs the pall hanging over the u s bond market is lifting a bit customer activity has been light but all on the buy side and there is a marked absence of selling they said in a weekly report philip braverman of irving trust securities inc believes banks will snap up the two and four year issues at this week s sales the banks are in need of investments that provide  ings though the yield spread to the cost of carrying these maturities has been wider it is still positive he said in a weekly market review but economists agreed not even the auctions will generate enough impetus for a major move this will only come once the overseas markets have had their run based on last week s events there is little to indicate that the appetite for yield has begun to wane said economists at salomon brothers inc indeed talk persisted last week that japanese investors are planning to re weight their portfolios in favour of the higher yielding markets at the start of japan s new fiscal year on april and while traditionally the japanese have not been big buyers of the shorter dated issues on offer at this week s u s auctions such reports undermine market confidence even actions by the british australian and canadian monetary authorities to curb the rise of their currencies should also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bond markets the salomon brothers economists said meanwhile ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven the u s market unless they deviate widely from expectations economists said this week s economic calendar begins on tuesday with february durable goods orders economists expect a rebound from january s depressed levels peter greenbaum of smith barney harris upham and co said several areas including transport equipment should have bounced back but a decline in military capital goods will cap total new orders he forecasts a rise of two pct after january s pct slump some other economists foresee a gain as large as five pct friday s consumer price report for february is expected to show an increase of about pct after a pct january gain economists said energy prices the driving force behind the january rise rose more moderately last month while food prices declined meanwhile economists warned that the federal funds rate will be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to the approach of quarter end and the mid april tax date some economists expect the fed to execute a bill pass this week because its adding requirement increases sharply in the new statement period beginning on thursday fed funds  d at pct late friday and are expected to open near that level reuter   u s credit markets end under extreme pressure the u s credit market ended under extreme pressure as the dollar s continued slide on the currency markets triggered an avalanche of u s securities sales pushing prices to lows dealers and analysts said this was a bloodbath said one money market economist we ve been trading in a state of total panic at times today said another mirroring the dollar s fall to a year low against the yen the key pct year treasury bond price fell nearly two points to close at compared with on friday the corresponding yield jumped to pct from reuter   u s fed explores commodity basket index the complex task of wielding control over monetary policy in an increasingly fast moving global economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices the newest member of the federal reserve board says commodity prices are already considered by the fed in the making of monetary policy but they would be given a much greater role under an idea being floated by governor robert heller who joined the board last august he conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed but argues that such an arrangement particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries could reduce the volatility of exchange rates moreover it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves slowing changes in inflation his idea which many conservative economists find appealing has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by president reagan it would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation key indicators such as unemployment and the rise or fall of the money supply changes in the money supply can lead to changes in rates and affect economic activity directly discussed on and off for a long time the commodity concept is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary policy and widely fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid base what is needed is an anchor or reference point that can serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary purposes says heller in the past this anchor was gold but the united states went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies a return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the soviet union and south africa the so called fixed rate system scuttled in the early s is still considered unworkable in the present world but the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely adding vast pressures to the monetary system is also being widely questioned some have suggested that the system might benefit from a formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also for one thing there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy moreover some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement the poorest countries have called for a monetary conference to work out a new system that not surprisingly helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems treasury secretary james baker the reagan administration s chief economic architect has preferred to use the so called group of five industrial countries or sometimes seven as a forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other economic matters he appears convinced that officials from west germany france britain japan italy and canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing the heller approach while extremely complex could have a profound impact on the system ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates as envisioned by heller a basket of say major commodities ranging from wheat to oil would be put together and prices would be measured on a regular basis in times of rising commodity prices monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices montary policy might be eased he says he notes that commodity prices are  d daily in auction markets and a commodity price index can be calculated on a virtually continuous basis moreover most commodity prices are produced consumed and  d on a world wide basis so that an index has a relevance for the entire world he says in addition commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in making their monetary policy decisions he says however he says that any major change in a basic commodity such as occurred in oil during the s because of action by the opec cartel would have to be discounted in such a system he says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities reuter   u s jobs data said to rule out fed tightening a steep drop in goods producing jobs detracted from u s march non farm payroll employment and makes it unlikely that the federal reserve will tighten monetary policy to defend the dollar economists said u s march non farm payroll employment rose less than the gain of to the financial markets expected manufacturing employment fell compared with february s gain while march construction employment dropped after being unchanged in february the momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we end the first quarter said stephen roach of morgan stanley and co inc this sets the stage for more sluggish growth in the second and third quarters the fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy he said they will not ease as long the dollar is weak but clearly they can t tighten david wyss of data resources inc said that the downward revision in february non farm payroll employment to from means that employment gains in the first quarter were weaker than expected while wyss left his first quarter forecast of real u s gross national product growth at pct he said the march jobs data suggested a downward revision in his second quarter growth forecast to pct from pct bill sullivan of dean witter reynolds inc said the average monthly gain in non farm jobs in the first quarter was only compared with in the fourth quarter of there s momentum in first quarter labor force activity but less than assumed he said gains in goods producing jobs were subdued at best this rules out any possibilty of the fed tightening for exchange related purposes in march the average workweek fell back to its january level of hours from hours in february manufacturing hours also fell back to their january level totalling hours in march compared with hours in february the commerce department noted that loss of manufacturing jobs in march was concentrated in automobile electrical and electronic manufacturing robert brusca of nikko securities international said that a decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs economists said that a build up in auto inventories resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in the first quarter gnp accounts roach said he expects first quarter u s gnp to rise two pct to be followed by a gain of pct at best in the second and third quarters he said the march drop in industrial activity is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate contribution inventory accumulation made to gnp economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains in industrial production and personal income for march they expect only marginal gains if not small declines for these indicators compared with a february increases of pct in industrial production and pct in personal income steve slifer of lehman government securities said the drop in march construction employment may also signal a drop in march housing starts which rose pct in february to million units at an annual rate from million units in january the rate of unemployment fell to pct its lowest level since march from pct in february but wyss pointed out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force which fell to mln in march from mln in february this just means that there were fewer people looking for work so the drop in unemployment doesn t mean much he said he said the latest employment report will not concern the fed because it does points to gnp growth in the first half of pct but it does suggest they can t afford to tighten to quickly either the statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated march labor force gains just as seasonal factors probably overstated them in january and february slifer said but are consistent with his forecast of pct first quarter gnp growth economic growth remains sluggish but silfer does not think that the federal open market committee changed policy at their meeting this week at some point they will be more inclined to ease he said for the time being however the march employment report increases the likelihood they won t tighten regardless of the dollar reuter   u s treasury policies said unchanged by departure the departure of james baker s closest aide deputy treasury secretary richard darman will not change the course of washington s domestic and international economic policies u s officials said darman who has worked alongside baker for six years was widely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives on currency management and international economic cooperation u s officials said darman also played a key role in shepherding president reagan s sweeping tax reform plan through the u s congress but they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure to the investment banking firm of shearson lehman brothers signaled the baker team was breaking up or that the treasury secretary himself might leave soon it really does not mean that he took the opportunity as it came up one official said another commented baker will miss him but he s not going to stand in his way there has been widespread speculation since last autumn that darman sought a wall street job officials said darman felt the passage of tax reform late last year marked an appropriate moment to bow out baker acknowledged darman would be sorely missed dick darman has contributed mightily to the success of this administration over the past six years and his departure represents a substantial loss he said u s officials admitted darman s absence would be an undoubted blow to baker who has relied on him for policy advice both at the white house and in reagan s second term at the treasury one aide once described darman as indispensable to baker baker is widely thought to want a more stable currency system and darman is generally credited by officials of other nations as baker s leading theorist on this issue favouring target zones to limit currency fluctuations earlier this year monetary sources said the u s treasury unsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system but a u s official disputed the assessment that with darman gone baker would abandon international initiatives baker s work as head of reagan s economic policy council spearheading policy and his skills in negotiating with the democrat controlled congress will go on as before darman s strength was not as an economist but as a political strategist and that s baker s strength too the official said there were already indications that baker who throughout his time in government has relied on a closely knit circle of advisers has moved swiftly to find a successor one possibility is that baker might turn to george gould who holds the number three treasury position of under secretary gould another close confidante has known baker for years before joining the treasury in november gould was a partner at the wall steet firm of wertheim and co and formerly headed donaldson lufkin and jenrette securities corp the darman announcement came on the eve of the semi annual meetings of the international monetary fund and the world bank where many policies darman helped shape will be debated he helped baker devise the september plaza agreement when the united states japan west germany france and britain curbed the dollar s strength the pact was a major turning point in u s policy ending a period of disdain for economic cooperation and intervention in currency markets darman also worked on some other baker initiatives like the tokyo summit agreement to intensify coordination of economic policies among the leading industrial countries and the recent paris agreement to stabilise currencies and stimulate global growth these policies are collectively aimed at redressing the huge gap between japan and west germany s surpluses and the united state s massive deficit that policy goal still remains a prime objective of the reagan administration and will not change with darman s departure reuter   u s treasury s baker says currencies within ranges that better reflect fundamentals   u s treasury s baker sees rate stability treasury secretary james baker said the agreement among the industrial countries reached in paris last month should foster stability of exchange rates at around current levels in testimony before the house appropriations committee baker outlined many of the measures taken designed to achieve more balanced growth and a reduction of imbalances during the paris meeting these measures should also foster greater stability of exchange rates around current levels he said baker reiterated that the ministers at the paris meeting agreed that their currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and that further substantial exchange rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects he added in these circumstances we agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around current levels reuter   u s treasury s mulford reaffirms g pact to foster currency stability around current levels   uk money market deficit revised to one

government to continue its flexible negotiations on exchange rates through procedures such as the recent paris meeting of industrialized countries in a letter to house banking committee chairman fernand st germain volcker said he opposed legislation to formalize international negotiations on exchange rates and to require treasury secretary james baker to disclose plans for currency intervention volcker s letter was written march in advance of the committee s march approval of the proposed legislation the fundamental policy objectives of the united states can best be implemented in a more flexible framework such as through the recent meeting in paris of finance ministers and central bank governors volcker said he recommended congress not lock the administration into formal procedures for international exchange rate negotiations to achieve specific exchange rate goals the achievement of a sustainable pattern of u s international transactions and more stability in exchange rates are ones with which i remain sympathetic he said the banking committee s bill directs the administration to to start negotiations to reach a competitive exchange rate for the u s dollar runs the risk of build up potentially destabilizing market expectations volcker said a requirement that baker disclose his intervention policy could reduce the usefulness of intervention as a tool to deal with exchange rate volatility volcker added baker has also opposed the legislation which will be wrapped into a major bill for consideration in the house in late april the senate will consider its version of the bill in may reuter   volcker says restrictive monetary policy would hurt investment   volcker sees tight policy hurting investment federal reserve board chairman paul volcker said a restrictive monetary policy would be damaging to investment and that a better course would be to restrain spending a restrictive monetary policy would hit investment you don t want to put rates up unless you have to volcker told the senate banking committee that is not a constructive way to proceed he said volcker said that given a choice between squeezing the budget deficit or squeezing investment he would favor squeezing the budget deficit in response to a question about banks volcker said he would be pleased if congress decided to give banks a tax writeoff as an incentive for them to take greater reserves against loans to debtor countries if you give a tax writeoff for reserving against loans then we will see more reserving and that would make me happy volcker told committee chairman sen william proxmire d wisc reuter   volcker urges greater exchange rate stability federal reserve board chairman paul volcker said international policymakers should make improving the stability of exchange rates a major priority in testimony before a senate banking subcommittee volcker said he does not have any specific proposals for improving exchange rate stability but thought it was worthy goal i do think we ought to be thinking about and working toward greater exchange rate stability volcker said i think that the objective of greater exchange rate stability ought to loom larger among our various policy priorities reuter   yeutter puts currency burden on taiwan korea responsibility for the appreciation of the taiwan dollar and the south korean won lies soley with those countries said u s representative clayton yeutter speaking to the asia society yeutter said that it is in those countries own long term to raise the value of their currencies against the dollar yeutter was responding to a question about what the u s could do to encourage appreciation of those currencies against the dollar in order to reduce the large u s deficits with taiwain and korea an undervalued currency will help those countries exports in the short term but in the long run they have to be concerned about how they are perceived in the international business community yeutter said for taiwan yeutter said that with its per capita surplus with the u s much larger than that of japan s and with huge foreign exchange reserves it was difficult to defend the high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in that country he also said that the south korean won should begin to move to reflect underlying economic fundamentals otherwise in two or three years time korea will be in the same situation that prevails in taiwan turning to the u s deficit with japan of more than billion dlrs yeutter said that this situation was not sustainable something must give soon if not there is a great threat of u s legislative action to counteract that trend yeutter said reuter   zambia imf talks hit problems over food subsidies zambia s talks with the world bank and international
