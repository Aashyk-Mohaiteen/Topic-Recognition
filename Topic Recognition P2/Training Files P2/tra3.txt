t a senate finance committee hearing on the bill byrd and house speaker jim wright a texas democrat have made legislation a priority this year and a wide ranging bill is being readied for probable house approval next month japan s bilateral surplus jumped from billion dlrs in to billion dlrs last year its surplus rose to billion dlrs in february from billion dlrs in january congress points to the record billion dlrs u s deficit in and the slow response in the imbalance to the dollar s decline in world currency markets as a reason to press japan to buy more u s goods they are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration in u s exports of sophisticated computer technology in response to the growing anger and pressure by the u s semiconductor industry president reagan friday announced he intended to raise tariffs as much as mln dlrs on japanese electronic goods in retaliation for japan s failure to abide by a u s japanese semiconductor agreement congress also has been been angered by the administration s lack of success with japan on a host of other issues including beef citrus automobile parts telecommunications goods and financial services the bulk of the house bill was written last week in four committees it is a package of sanctions and measures to force the administration take tough action against foreign barriers and unfair competition although most provisions do not single out japan in many cases their impact would be to restrict imports of japanese products or make them more expensive with higher duties the cornerstone of the legislation passed the house ways and means committee by a vote of to its focus is to force president reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign competition and to make it easier for u s industries to win temporary relief from surges in imports the most controversial issue an amendment to restrict imports if countries such as japan with large surpluses do not buy more u s goods was left for an april vote by the house rep richard gephardt a democratic presidential aspirant from missouri has the support of wright and other key democrats to press for passage of the amendment the measure would have the most impact on japan west germany taiwan and south korea if japan for example does not reduce its barriers by mid the united states would set import quotas or tariffs to cut japanese surplus by ten per cent a year for three years i m tired of going into companies and having managers say to me we re not over competing in japan because we can t compete in the marketplace that argument needs to be taken away from american business gephardt said the administration has said it could not support a bill containing such a provision   economic spotlight u s deficit with nics the u s deficit with taiwan and korea is expected to widen this year despite some economic and currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries economists said the surpluses that taiwan and korea ran with the u s in will get bigger this time next year the u s will be screaming at those countries about their exports said steve cerier of manufacturers hanover trust co taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the u s after japan and canada while korea is the seventh largest faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in congress the reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against taiwan and korea urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free the thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries nics amid signs the dollar s steep drop against the currencies of japan and most ec nations previously the main focus of the u s drive to cut its gap is beginning to close the competiveness gap for american goods u s treasury secretary james baker said recently that he expects a reduction in japan s surplus this year but u s manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to taiwan and korea whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark as major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs taiwanese and korean exporters are well placed to take up the slack in the fashionable comment in washington was japan bashing now it s nic bashing said robert chandross of lloyds bank plc asia s four main nics hong kong south korea singapore and taiwan accounted for almost one fifth of the overall billion dlr u s merchandise deficit for the u s gap with taiwan rose to billion dlrs in from billion in while the bilateral deficit with south korea grew to billion from billion and preliminary u s data show that the growth trend is continuing the u s shortfall with taiwan was billion dlrs in january up pct from a year earlier the gap with korea was mln dlrs up pct from a year ago lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient tensions korea said it is choosing many of the items on which the u s wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation still south korean minister rha woong bae said last week that korea would maintain a surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its billion dlr foreign debt for its part taiwan said in january that it will cut tariffs on goods sometime in the second half of and try to diversify exports but vice economic minister wang chien shien said last month that he still does not expect taiwan s surplus with the u s will fall in the nics have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods but korea is raising its profile in the area of big ticket manufactured goods notably cars korea expects its auto exports mostly for north america to balloon to units in from zero in the nics exports are almost all manufactured goods when their exports rise it hits the heart of the u s manufacturing base it cuts directly to us and to our customers said bob wendt manager for economic studies at bethlehem steel corp the u s takes pct of korea s computer products exports pct of its electrical appliances and pct of its telecommunications equipment a recent study by morgan guaranty trust co says taiwan and south korea are the most pressing issue for the u s while hong kong and singapore run surpluses with the u s these are offset by their deficits with other countries but taiwan and to a lesser extent south korea stand in marked contrast both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the u s and major overrall and current account surpluses the morgan study says morgan expects taiwan s overall surplus to grow to billion dlrs in from billion last year and korea s to increase to billion dlrs from billion concern about the nics is not confined to the u s a lot of korea and taiwan s exports to the u s have been at japan s expense said richard koss at general motors corp february s paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted nics to lower barriers and revalue currencies but this two pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and in any case will only work with a sizeable lag economists say the u s has not said how much it thinks the taiwan s and korea s currencies should climb the taiwan dollar which is pegged to the u s dollar has risen about pct since september while the korean won has risen about five pct but in real terms the taiwan dollar has been flat against the u s unit and the won has lost seven pct economists say we ve not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes said bethlehem steel s wendt and so far u s pleas for taiwan and korea to use their hefty export  ings to import more have had little effect moreover it is uncertain how far u s protectionism will get given the administration s free stance it s hard to see that anything will be passed much before year end and then the question is will it have teeth one economist said reuter   egypt soviets to renegotiate arms debt terms egypt and the soviet union are expected to sign an agreement in moscow next week settling cairo s three billion dlr military debt egyptian officials said one official who

reuter   envoy advises nakasone to prepare for u s visit the japanese ambassador to the u s suggested that prime minister yasuhiro nakasone make efforts to present advanced proposals on issues when he visits washington next month ambassador nobuo matsunaga made the recommendation at a meeting with nakasone kyodo news service said matsunaga also advised that the prime minister should be prepared to discuss u s japan economic issues matsunaga cited issues such as a u s japan micro chip pact foreign access to the kansai international airport project and a new international telecommunications firm matsunaga returned on sunday to report to japanese leaders on recent u s developments over in preparation for nakasone s visit to washington april to may kyodo quoted nakasone as telling reporters after meeting the envoy i entirely accept what ambassador matsunaga recommended nakasone did not elaborate the u s japan dispute intensified last week when president ronald reagan said the u s would impose heavy tariffs on japanese imports in retaliation against alleged japanese breach of the computer chip pact meanwhile nakasone s ruling liberal democratic party ldp is to consider measures to boost imports and open up the japanese market such as government purchase of supercomputers and expanding foreign access to the kansai airport project party sources said the ldp international economic affairs council was responding to nakasone s request for measures to reduce japan s increasing surpluses with the u s and europe they said reuter   europe on sidelines in u s japan microchip row rising imports of japanese made cars and electronic goods may upset west european officials but they generally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latest row between the united states and japan japan s huge surplus is a sore point in west europe as it is in the united states but u s charges of unfair practices involving computer microchips leave europeans cold the european community ran a billion dlr deficit with japan last year and seeks redress when it feels japanese policy hurts europeans diplomats and economists said but only in britain has there been any suggestion of acting with the u s to do something about japan s huge surplus the ec is no more illiberal on issues than is the u s said martin wolf director of studies at the policy research centre in london basically their policies are pretty much the same but that did not mean europe would support the u s or that the ec would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage of the u s dispute to press its own claims wolf said basically europeans have a different approach to problems he said in the u s people talk about fair but not here he added in the u s it all has to do with the general ethic of free competition while in europe the general approach is that liberal is good because it makes countries rich wolf said this basic u s attitude explains washington s tendency to impose so called countervailing duties an import tax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair in western europe the approach to disputes tends to be to try to reach a settlement through negotiation wolf said in the latest u s japan row president reagan has threatened to raise tariffs on selected japanese electronic goods by as much as mln dlrs alleging that japan has failed to abide by a u s japan pact on microchip but the european community has challenged the agreement as a violation of general agreement on tariffs and gatt practices that discriminates against its microchip producers it follows that they re not likely to rally to the side of the united states in defence of the agreement said wolf although british parliamentarians are pushing for a tough line on japanese issues government officials in the rest of europe told reuter correspondents they would let the ec take the lead in any response to the u s japan row a spokeswoman for the ec commission in brussels told reuters there has been no change in the community s position since a march meeting of foreign ministers which sent a strong warning to tokyo on imbalances in a statement issued after that meeting ec foreign ministers deplored japan s continued imbalance and appealed for a greater japanese effort to open up its markets ec external commissioner willy de clercq said after the talks there was a growing impatience with japan in the ec diplomats accredited to the ec in brussels said they saw no signs of any immediate intention to impose any broad ranging sanctions against japan the ec is anxious to avoid provoking a war they said instead the community is trying to target problem areas in european with japan including wines and spirits cosmetics and financial services and will continue talking to try to improve the situation the diplomats said in britain where the government is angered over the difficulties telecommunications giant cable and wireless has faced in its bid to crack the japanese market officials said last week that retaliatory action is being considered but government officials said last night we are not talking about days or weeks this is going to take time they said the government would consider its options at a cabinet meeting on thursday but added that no final decisions were expected the main thing the british would threaten the japan with is denial of access to london s booming financial markets government officials said reuter   european community to set up office in peking china and the european community ec signed an agreement on the establishment of an ec office here chinese vice

its foreign deficit is misplaced and the country s real problem lies in its large federal budget deficit the general agreeement on tariffs and gatt said by stressing its record deficit of billion dlrs last year the u s was fuelling protectionist pressure which threatens the world trading system it said in an annual report the fundamental problem the size of the u s federal budget deficit could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt it said gatt also predicted world would grow by only pct in a full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years gatt experts urged washington to resist protectionism and instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current account payments deficit higher private savings lower investment and a smaller federal budget deficit raising u s barriers would result in little or no reduction in the current account deficit it would however increase inflation and reduce world it said the basic cause some combination of insufficient domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit would remain the report said gatt economists said expansion would slow this year because of slower growth forecasts in japan and some west european nations as they adjust production and workforces to a low dollar risk of higher u s inflation concerns over third world debt management and looming protectionism the report also said imbalances in the current accounts of japan west germany and the u s had increased in the most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies it added thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not borne out last year the report said gatt warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the u s inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly expanding money supply and low dollar such a development could worsen the business climate by increasing uncertainty and pushing up rates which in turn would adversely affect world but the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the united states despite the dollar s depreciation which makes foreign products more expensive it suggested that resources idle in the u s both human and in underutilised factories were not geared to produce the goods and services sought from abroad world in manufactures grew by only three pct in about half of the rate of the previous year in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this

during next week s meetings and will undoubtedly be embraced by the developing countries there s on the part of some countries for looking at the support of the special problems of the very poorest countries because their position is so extreme a reagan administration official said he suggested washington was open to disussing the issue the meetings will also assess the success of the baker debt

critical foreign exchange but the united states wants to cut its deficit running at a record billion dlrs and is pressing others to import more from developing countries the discussions from april six to will be wide ranging touching everything from rates to the impact of development loans on the environment according to monetary sources the talks will include an examination of protectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the reagan administration to place some mln dlrs in tariffs on microchip products from japan the sources said the move accelerated the dollar s decline as financial markets grew alarmed that war was in the offing there is concern that the action prompted by u s charges that japan has been selling computer chip products below fair market value and has kept its own market closed to imports further undermining the international trading system at the same time the ministers will discuss the fundamental price weakness in basic commodities the export

wheat tobacco tea coffee jute engineering and electronic goods as well as minerals including iron ore are all on offer in return for oil petroleum products chemicals steel and machinery sources told reuters most of the impetus behind counter  which began in comes from two state trading firms the state trading corp stc and the minerals and metals trading corp mmtc the two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote indian exports a commerce ministry spokeswoman said adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading one source said india has targetted countries that depend on an indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports however counter  deals still make up only a small part of india s total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated billion dlrs in during the nine months ended december the sources said counter  accounted for just five pct of india s billion dlrs in during fiscal ended march against almost nothing in official figures show however the figures exclude exchanges with the eastern bloc paid in non convertible indian rupees the sources said total with the soviet union involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for soviet arms and oil is estimated at billion dlrs in fiscal against three billion in indian counter  which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country s large deficit is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by indonesia venezuela and brazil the sources said the deficit which hit an estimated record billion dlrs in is expected to decline to billion in the current fiscal year but the push to include non communist countries in counter  is also due to other factors including the slow growth of foreign reserves a tight debt repayment schedule shrinking aid and protectionism businessmen said one source said india is showing more dynamism in promoting counter  deals than in the past when the deals were made discreetly because they break gatt rules as a member of the general agreement on tariffs and gatt india cannot officially support bartering the mmtc s recent counter  deals include iron ore exports to yugoslavia for steel structures and rails mmtc s recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to india a official said adding that the policy remains flexible we also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to india the

analyst drew peck of donaldson lufkin and jenrette said but analysts said the price rises have been slight so far and some questioned whether japan would be successful in forcing japanese companies to cut production in the long run others however were more optimistic saying evidence was already in hand that japan has cut back prodution and halted sales to the grey market the third country brokers that sell chips at below production costs we ve seen the grey market begin to dry up for d rams and it has virtually dried up for eproms said merrill lynch analyst thomas kurlack of the two key memory chips used in computers prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are stretching kurlack added industry analysts said japan s ministry of international and industry or miti had requested the cut backs in production to meet the terms of last year s semiconductor accord with the u s the reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on japanese electronic goods alleging that japan had failed to live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer components in the u s market but some analysts said japan s attempt to mollify the u s was a double edged sword and might be read at a subtle form of retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the u s as production in japan is cut these analysts argue prices will rise in the u s and few american semiconductor manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long ago exited the market for memory chips u s computer makers that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured the japanese are looking for ways to reduce pressures from washington but at the same time they re demonstating their muscle analyst peck said the cut backs in japanese production are expected to benefit u s chip makers i think this could be a very important factor for u s semiconductor manufacturers industry analyst elliot levine of ladenburg thalmann co said but analyst peck said it will take a few weeks to see whether japan has genuinely cut production he said japanese manufactures were likely to view miti s request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and production cut backs would lead to significant write offs in plant and equipment reuter   japan denies breaking semiconductor pact japan denied breaking a pact with the u s on semiconductor but said prices set out in the pact were too high and acknowledged difficulties in implementing the accord we are faithfully abiding by the agreement but of course there are some problems a spokesman for the international and industry ministry told reuters he said the high semiconductor prices recommended by the agreement were leaving japanese manufacturers piling up stocks of unsellable products we are aiming to reduce production in japan but of course this takes time he said the spokesman said some japanese companies were selling chips in europe and asia below stipulated prices but added it is only a matter of time before we solve this problem the eight month old pact aims to stop japan selling large quantities of chips at knock down prices to the united states
