liquidity at the end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits money dealers said as a result call money soared in active trading to around the lombard rate of five pct from pct yesterday as banks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily billion marks in free minimum reserve assets at the central bank over the first days of the month though this was above the march requirement of billion actual holdings at the weekend were billion to meet the daily average dealers said banks must raise holdings by two billion marks to billion today and tomorrow but liquidity was tight in early business because banks excessively took up the bundesbank s offer for sale of treasury bills on friday this provides a rate of pct for three day deposits and is an effective floor to the market though some liquidity from bills bought on thursday flowed back into the market today the bulk would not return until tomorrow the start of the new month dealers said dealers said the large banks which they did not name commanded short term money requirements of as much as five billion marks or so with a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the month the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills draining liquidity for three days when other banks sought funds rates rose and large banks were able to place excess funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return one senior dealer said the bundesbank with advanced knowledge of the market s needs should have curtailed its sales of treasury bills on friday though dealers only late in the day l  of the total minimum reserve holdings of the previous day the bundesbank has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate the strength of demand for funds the following day he said bundesbank dealers could easily have said we are not selling any treasury bills or we re not selling them in this amount he said if the bundesbank wants to finely steer the market then they should avoid such excesses tomorrow it will be different call money will fall back to pct or so but the bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in rates given the delicate state of currency markets international central banks have been at pains to prevent a dollar fall against major currencies including the mark dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer undertone contributing to downward pressure on the dollar the whole tender policy is to have a call money of between three and four pct in that case the excesses as we have today cannot be very popular the senior dealer said dealers said the large banks probably achieved average rates of return on their excess funds of between pct or four pct this is a higher return than they would have  ed without the excessive draining through the treasury bill mechanism because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations between germany s major employers and the unions the bundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to monetary policy at its council meeting on thursday they said bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the lombard emergency funding facility to draw down billion marks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business reuter   chicago futures leader says markets can adapt foreign currency futures markets would not be harmed if the leading industrial countries agreed to restrict currency movements to within a narrow band said leo melamed chairman of the chicago mercantile exchange s cme executive committee the target zone would not affect our market i think at all a pct range in the deutsche mark gives us a healthy market melamed told reuters in an interview we were willing to live in the old smithsonian era with a four pct shift he said referring to permitted currency fluctuations in the early s one thing you can adjust is to make each contract a larger value as chairman of the cme in melamed was instrumental in the development of currency futures which now are crucial to the chicago exchange melamed said capital flows which he estimated can approach billion dlrs a day would overwhelm efforts by governments to control currency fluctuations they can do it for a day in terms of intervention an hour a week maybe but not over a period of time so it s unrealistic and it doesn t work and it s unnecessary the cme s top policymaker also said a decision by the exchange to advance the quarterly settlement time of its stock index futures contract to the morning from the afternoon would help eliminate dramatic price gyrations in futures and equity markets on so called triple witching day we think that the settlement in the morning will have a salutary effect so that over a longer period of time i think this issue triple witching will go away because of the change in the structure as of next june when the move is scheduled to go into effect he said melamed said proposed changes in floor practices by  rs of the popular standard and poor s stock index future would address complaints of trading abuses and stimulate trading two weeks ago the cme board of directors proposed barring brokers on the top step of the pit from trading for their own account the board also proposed requiring brokers engaged in dual trading elsewhere in the pit to record personal  s to the nearest minute and curbing trading between broker groups the changes will in time have an extremely positive effect on the marketplace that s going to prove very very instrumental in increasing volume over time he said predicting the increase would come within a year melamed also chairman of dellsher investment co inc said the cme last week withdrew a proposal to put a point limit on the s and p index s daily price movement when the commodity futures trading commission told the exchange it could not be a temporary program the cme also received many negative comments many more than we anticipated melamed conceded many futures commission merchants predicted sell orders would accelerate in the event the price approached the bottom limit reuter   china allows nationwide foreign exchange saving people

foreign exchange certificates fecs had been postponed due to objections from foreign businessmen and others but tian told a news conference the chinese government still considered fecs unsatisfactory asked about the current state of plans to abolish the fecs tian said we have decided to postpone the question as to whether it will be done in the future it will be done according to the evolution of the situation he said many people including foreign businessmen had raised objections to the plan to abolish the certificates and added it is rather complicated the fecs were introduced in for use by foreigners in china but they now circulate widely among local residents and there is a big black market in the currency though it is theoretically at par with the ordinary chinese currency renminbi tian said the government still considered that the fecs had many demerits and negative influences bank of china president wang deyan told reuters earlier this month that he thought it unlikely that the certificates would be scrapped this year western diplomats and economists have said the chinese authorities are having trouble finding a suitable alternative vice premier yao yilin announced at a

exchange rates almost within levels agreed by major nations sumita   dollar seen falling unless japan spurs economy underlying dollar sentiment is bearish and operators may push the currency to a new low unless japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the paris accord foreign exchange analysts polled by reuters said here the dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of yen and to fall even below that level a senior dealer at one leading bank said the dollar has eased this week but remains stable at around yen six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in paris in february to foster currency stability some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term but a drastic fall is unlikely because of u s fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced japanese purchases of u s treasury securities needed to finance the u s deficit dealers generally doubted whether any economic package japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its surplus significantly and said such measures would probably invite further u s steps to weaken the dollar under the paris accord tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal budget was passed to boost domestic demand increase imports and cut its surplus but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future the dealers said if no such steps are taken protectionist sentiment in the u s congress will grow putting greater downward pressure on the dollar they said the factors affecting the u s currency have not changed since before the paris accord they added underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still sluggish u s economic outlook the international debt crisis triggered by brazil s unilateral suspension of payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the reagan administration as a result of the iran contra arms scandal said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank there is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around yen by the end of this year said chemical bank tokyo branch vice president yukuo takahashi but operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention dealers said there were widespread rumours that the u s federal reserve telephoned some banks in new york to ask for quotes last wednesday and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to marks the bank of england also apparently sold sterling in london when it neared dlrs on wednesday they said but other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central bank intervention saying it may stimulate the dollar s decline because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars however first national bank of chicago tokyo branch assistant manager hiroshi mochizuki said the dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of march other dealers said the u s seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on march because a weak dollar would give japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings which could make them lose in purchases of u s

finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for greater cooperation to strengthen the european monetary system ems against international market turbulence officials said there was a general will to reinforce the european monetary system with all that implies belgian finance minister mark eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one day session of informal talks at this belgian coastal resort the gathering was the first such discussion since the second major realignment of ems parities within nine months in january the system has come under severe strain as funds have flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant ems currency the west german mark sending it soaring against weaker currencies in the system but eyskens said february s agreement between leading western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels was working and this would allow the ec to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the ems he told a news conference yesterday s meeting agreed on the need for closer coordination among ems member governments of rate policies and of rate differentials between different countries they also agreed they needed better coordination of exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable both when they reached their fixed ems limits and within their agreed margins but eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in luxembourg in june on the basis of proposals from the ec s monetary committee and committee of central bank governors he said the ec needed a set of indicators of economic convergence betwen community countries and it was important that rates fulfilled this role together with exchange rates and inflation rates the belgian minister whose country presently holds the presidency of the community made clear the meeting had not produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing the ems towards the ec s long term goal of economic and monetary integration we have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal functioning of the system eyskens said eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the ems has to be reinforced if the ec s plans to liberalise all movements of capital across national borders by are to go ahead ec executive commission president j ues delors told the meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final phase of capital market liberalisation in october that would include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the move would create difficulties eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also discussed the need to dedramatise realignments of ems parities by letting high ranking monetary officials carry them out by telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers however west german sources said bonn finance minister gerhard stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson told journalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater coordination of exchange market intervention was the question of which currencies should be used to intervene and held in central bank reserves he said several ems member countries believed the ems would work better if central banks held each other s currencies an issue of particular importance regarding west germany since the bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves he said the debate on dedramatising ems realignments reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the january reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory the realignment was marked by acrimony between france and west germany with each side blaming the other for strains in the system that forced the parity overhaul reuter   ec ministers will discuss strengthening ems float european community finance ministers and central bankers meet in belgium this weekend to discuss strengthening europe s

chiefs would discuss the situation on currency markets in the light of the february agreement among leading industrialised countries to stabilise exchange rates around present levels in an interview eyskens said he felt the paris accord between the united states japan west germany france britain and canada had proved itself more or less workable but doubts over its effectiveness and durability have been growing since fears of a war between the united states and japan over computer microchips pushed the dollar to a record low against the surging yen early this week the talks at the belgian resort of knokke are being held to coordinate the ec s positions on monetary issues and third world debt ahead of the spring meetings of the international monetary fund and world bank in washington next week the ec gathering begins tonight with a dinner but the main discussions will take place tomorrow continued international currency turbulence could undermine plans for reinforcing the european monetary system the joint float holding eight ec currencies within narrow fluctuation bands which will feature high on the weekend agenda eyskens has repeatedly said that europe needs a period of calm on world currency markets and in particular a more stable dollar before it can set about strengthening the ems to make it more resilient against exchange rate swings the ems has been taking a battering over the last year as the falling dollar has sent funds surging into the dominant ems currency the west german mark forcing ministers to undertake two major realignments of parities within nine months in the interview eyskens made clear he was hoping for a wide ranging discussion on the future of the eight year old ems on the basis of proposals for bolstering it drawn up by the ec s monetary committee and the committee of central bank governors the committees were asked to come up with the proposals after the last reshuffle of ems exchange rates in january eyskens repeated calls for the european currency unit the fledgling ec currency at the core of the system to take over the mark s dominant role in the ems a proposal that has met with a cool response in west germany he said ec commission president j ues delors would report to the meeting on problems raised by plans to liberalise capital movements fully within the nation bloc by such as the need for harmonising taxes and banking controls eyskens said liberalisation of capital movements without strengthening the ems would be an element of destabilisation in the community he said the crucial issue in the debate was whether member states were willing to push further towards the ec s goal of monetary integration on the basis of an ems that included management of exchange rates by some kind of common institution instead of by national central banks as at present plans for the creation of such an institution foreseen by the ems s founding fathers have been thwarted by the reluctance of some countries notably west germany to gove up their sovereignty in the monetary field ems development has also been held up by britain s refusal so far to join the system s core exchange rate mechanism reuter   economic

in economic and monetary matters the basic problem of the ems is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common said one economist who has closely watched the system s development the result is that the ec is often divided over policy on third currencies accentuating what the economists say is the system s greatest weakness its vulnerability to a weak dollar over the past months as the u s dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies the resulting sharp rise of the west german mark severely strained the system another frustration has been britain s failure to lend the ems political support by keeping the pound still a major world currency outside the system no change in the british government s attitude is expected before the country s next general elections due by mid meanwhile the system s last realignment the th since it was set up prompted european finance ministers to ask the ec s highly secretive monetary committee and committee of central bank governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in belgium early next month but economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details they are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change technical measures won t be enough to protect the ems against external factors such as dollar weakness for that we must take the step forward to the institutional level said leo de corel of kredietbank s economic research department economists say the system s fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange
