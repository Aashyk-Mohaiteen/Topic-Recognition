a large dutch animal feed compounder will begin formal legal proceedings early next month as a test case on the way the ec co responsibility levy is applied a spokesman for dutch and feed association het comite told reuters het comite has been co ordinating national actions against alleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and since december has lodged more than individual cases with the business appeal court in the hague the basic complaint is that the levy does not take account of currency cross rates of exchange and therefore compounders in countries with strong currencies may have to pay more in their own currency than is paid to them by producers in another country het comite has obtained a temporary agreement that companies can pay the amount they receive toward the levy rather than paying a full guilder amount to the dutch commodity board the spokesman said het comite will provide financial and legal backing to the test case in the business administration court in the hague oral proceedings are to begin on april the spokesman said het comite finally selected the company for the test case from among the lodged because the bill the firm received from the commodity board for payment of the levy contained significant currency distortions and involved from a wide variety of origins the name of the company is not being made public the administration court is not expected to make a final ruling on the case in the near future the het comite spokesman said it was very likely it would refer questions to the appeal court in luxembourg and as a result it

government to follow through on earlier statements and seek a complete review in brussels of the way in which the levy is collected the spokesman said het comite as a member of fefac the association of european animal feed manufacturers is also a party to actions protesting the whole levy in the luxembourg appeal court reuter   ec member states cool on cereal plans european community ec member
