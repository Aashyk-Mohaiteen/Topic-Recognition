the data we have in hand do not provide clearcut evidence that the deterioration in the balance has yet been reversed volcker said in remarks prepared for delivery to a luncheon for community leaders here however volcker said there are encouraging signs particularly the rising volume of exports over the past year achieved despite relatively slow growth abroad volcker warned it is not sustainable from an economic perspective to pile up foreign debt while failing to make the investment needed to generate growth and the money to service the debt he said the process of restoring external balance to the u s economy requires dealing with the budget deficit he said needed economic adjustment will require a relative shift of financial and real resources into internationally competitive industry more of our growth will need to be reflected in net exports and business investment and less in consumption volcker said reuter   no pessimism for german exporters ministry firms need not be pessimistic about export prospects even though foreign markets have become more difficult because of the mark s strength the economics ministry said the ministry s parliamentary state secretary ludolf georg von wartenberg told a business conference german exports could start rising again in real terms during reversing the lower export trend which emerged in mid but even if the turnaround did not occur there would be no need to worry about the economy as long as the weakness of exports did not affect currently good domestic demand von wartenberg said consumer demand remained quite good but noted there had been a cooling in the investment climate this is certainly a reason for heightened watchfulness but not for stimulative steps he said the best way for bonn to help its exporters is to work actively to promote free world he added von wartenberg said the economy still had good export opportunities price alone was not the only factor in international competitiveness he said adding german firms have a reputation for high quality standards prompt delivery times and good service von wartenberg said the government was in a difficult position on its figures it faced international pressure to reduce its surplus but west germans were worried about the effect of the mark s strength on the country s exporters reports about the surplus especially overseas tended to concentrate on nominal figures which rose to a record billion marks in he said but this rise was due entirely to the lower value of imports caused by the decline of both the dollar and oil prices german exports have in fact been falling in real terms for sometime he said reuter   norway s deficit widens in february norway s deficit widened in february to mln crowns from mln crowns in january and mln crowns in

from pct and to pct for credits covering exports to the world s least developed nations additionally a new formula will be used for calculating the aid element in mixed credits to take account of different rates in the exporting countries the nation oecd which hosted the reform negotiations said minimum rates for officially subsidised loans have also been revised with the aim of cutting the subsidies and ending them completely on loans to relatively rich developing countries by july next year the reforms follow several years of pressure by the u s to stop competitors notably france and japan using foreign aid to subsidise exports putting u s firms at a disadvantage oecd officials said the agreement was based on a provisional accord reached in january subject to ratification by member governments some governments including austria had linked their final approval to other credit issues which would be discussed at a meeting here in mid april they added by raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixed credits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies too costly for frequent use a major loophole in the general agreement on tariffs and has been closed today a

the informal general agreement on tariffs and gatt meeting gave ministers from more than nations the chance to examine issues with which gatt did not have the political will to deal also the role of the developing countries has been emphasised in this particular meeting somehow it has been the perception of developing countries that gatt is a club of rich countries he added in an interview with reuters in fact many of the issues that have been tabled for discussion in the uruguay round of negotiations will be of more benefit to the developed countries he said concepcion said at the start of the taupo meeting that the uruguay round was meant to be a shining act of faith in the world system concepcion said the philippines would address the issues of in tropical fruit and the improvement of gatt machinery to make it more responsive he said tropical fruit came from developing countries but faced non tariff barriers quantitative restrictions or very high duties in other nations concepcion

white house officials said there was no immediate indication when reagan might act on the recommendations of his economic policy council to curb japanese exports to the united states but officials said the move could come today or early next week sources said the actions being weighed by reagan include tariffs on a wide variety of japanese exports which use semiconductors the sources said the tariffs could be slapped on personal computers television receivers and laser printers with the aim of penalizing japan s major electronic firms including nec corp hitachi ltd toshiba corp and fujitsu

will be sent to president reagan by the end of this year but he warned that his conciliatory message on the bill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn other countries their access to the american market would be curtailed unless they opened their markets to u s goods complaints about foreign restraints are not a smoke screen for protectionism they a plea for fairness rostenkowski said it is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the american market he added however he said there would likely be changes in the market access proposal from the plan which cleared the house last year that plan would have set a specific time table for foreign countries to ease import restraints or they would face a pct cut in exports to the united states reuter   rostenkowski reluctant to back tax hike house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back the tax increase if it did not have president reagan s support he told a national press club luncheon there would be a number of tax proposals that could be debated if reagan sought a tax increase to help balance the budget however he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates enacted in last year s tax reform bill unchanged there have been calls in congress to hold the rates at the level rather than allow them to fall next year reagan proposed billion dlrs in revenue as part of his budget proposal but it did not include general tax increases on issues rostenkowski said he did not expect the major bill this year would single out any u s industry for special protection to go after individual items in a bill is suicide he said this apparently ruled out congressional approval of another textile bill to limit quotas on textile imports as was proposed again this year reuter   rostenkowski says he will oppose protectionist bill in u s house   rotterdam signs cooperation agreement with tokyo the city of rotterdam today

in the same period the plan envisages giving incentives to importers not to import japanese goods and to exporters to sell more to japan the officials said they believed the japanese action one step

the growing trend toward protectionist legislation rha said i hope the leaders can get together to find a solution by making some mutually satisfactory concessions but he added the leaders seem

presented to china after china other important state trading countries including the soviet union will probably demand accession china s application could be considered a test case he said he said the ec strongly backed china s application but others among gatt s contracting parties took a tougher line among the numerous problems of a huge centrally run economy entering a free system are tariffs and reciprocity and the expectation that china will practice an open policy without discrimination de clercq added de clercq noted the different dimensions of the chinese economy and those of hungary and yugoslavia the two current socialist gatt members on china s import potential he said a foreign exchange shortage would force china to import less this year and next than in the past with an

why we should lag behind countries like italy which have a similar productive structure he said the plan calls for providing soft loans tax cuts and other fiscal benefits to exporters and raising spain s presence in international fairs consumer goods such as fashion and wine as well as traditional industrial exports will be promoted ruiz ligero said infe would double its annual budget to billion pesetas to finance the four year plan while the government s development aid fund fad would provide a special billion peseta grant the plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in real terms this year after a pct decline last year ruiz ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand which rose six pct last year after pct in he added that pct of spain s exports went to organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd countries the ec accounts for pct of the market and exports to the community rose seven pct last year the government plans to concentrate efforts on western europe and the u s the problem is convincing businessmen that exports are vital to survival in the context of ec competition

says u s canada pact would spur economies a free pact between the united states and canada could spur the economies of both sides substantially according to a study released by the institute for

s by about seven pct he said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of government subsidies end curbs on in services and investments and pave the way for new global talks under the general agreement on tariffs and the united states and canada the world s two biggest trading partners with cross border  ments of about billion dlrs a year opened free talks last june they are aiming for a pact by

access to federal government procurement in the two countries replacing current buy america and buy canada provisions with a buy north america provision fewer restrictions in in services chiefly finance and transportation a commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor domestic producers a commission to resolve bilateral disputes wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem the two sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to or pct without imposing coutervailing duties the limit on subsidies is now pct he proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset subsidies should go first a special disputes commission for resolution at an early stage wonnacott said bilateral free would contribute to the efficiency of the north american economies and to their competitiveness in facing overseas producers he said it would it would open u s markets to canadian goods and enable them to benefit from the economies of mass production benefits to the united states would be fewer than those to canada proportionately he said because of the already large u s gross national product wonnacott said also that a u s canada pact in such areas as export subsidies and the
