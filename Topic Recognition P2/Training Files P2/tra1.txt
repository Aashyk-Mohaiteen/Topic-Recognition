neglecting the area of greatest crisis in a statement to the informal gatt ministers conference here he said agriculture is a problem which involves all countries and seriously affects the debt servicing abilities of a number of developing countries he said major countries should be showing leader  on this problem we will be giving close attention to the processes in the oecd organisation of economic cooperation and development and elsewhere leading to the venice economic summit where we will be looking to the participants to adopt a strong commitment to agricultural reform dawkins said the venice summit is scheduled for june he said australia s  s in the uruguay round the eighth under the gatt are wide ranging dawkins said he sees the round as providing a timely opportunity to secure further meaningful liberalisation in all sectors and to restore confidence in the multilateral system dawkins said initial meetings of the negotiating groups established in geneva after the gatt declaration last september in punta del este uruguay have made a reasonable start but it is vital that ministers maintain the pressure on these processes we must see that the commitments made at punta del este on standstill and rollback are carried into practice the standstill and rollback of protection offers the global trading system a chance to hold and wind back protection during the negotiations which are expected to last up to four years he said reuter   baker says g pact just a start treasury secretary james baker said the agreement among industrial nations in paris last month is only a start in washington s drive to intensify economic cooperation among leading countries in a speech to the national newspaper association baker said the six steps beginning with the plaza agreement and culminating in the paris accord are only a start he added we see our role as a steward of a process in which we sit down with our industrial allies to find ways to promote more balanced international growth the paris agreements called surplus countries to strengthen their growth and on the u s to reduce its budget deficit under such circumstances the countries agreed their currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals baker also said he still sees ominous signs of pressure for protectionist legislation and this pressure for protectionism is coming from new areas of society but he also said he believed a coalition was forming that supported free reuter   baker sees lower japanese surplus u s treasury secretary james baker said the japanese surplus would begin to decline this year he told the national newspaper association you re going to see a reduction in the japanese surplus some of it this year but he said the reduction would be due

korea and taiwan and said that without an adjustment in exchange rates there is little likelihood of improvement speaking to the president s export council an industry advisory group baldrige said the deficit issue was under discussion with those countries i feel that unless we see an exchange rate adjustment we probably won t be able to see much of a change in the large surplus that taiwan in particular has with us he said in a wide ranging discussion on u s matters baldrige also repeated u s concern about an attempted takeover by japan s fujitsu company of fairchild computer he said that the japanese were resisting allowing u s companies into the giant computer business while at the same time attempting to  uire control of a u s company that does major computer business in the u s market lastly baldrige said that the united states was hopeful that it could complete a free market agreement with canada by the autumn but said major issues including acid rain remained unresolved

referring to the u s japan agreement on semiconductors said their government wants to live up to it their industries haven t been doing it and i think we ll have a good settlement to spare both sides i think the japanese understand full well that they haven t lived up to this commitment he said he added i do not think there will be a war at all on friday washington announced plans to put as much as mln dlrs in tariffs on japanese electronic goods from april because of tokyo s failure to observe the agreement the officials said the tariffs would be ended as soon as japan started adhering to the agreement but they said there was little chance japan could react quickly enough to avert the higher tariffs baldrige said the reagan administration hoped the strong u s action against japan would convince congress to tone down protectionist legislation now being drafted he denied the action had been taken for that reason reuter   baldrige predicts end of u s japan dispute the united states and

and let japan dominate the world electronics market baldrige told the senate finance committee the united states would insist japan open its markets to u s products as the u s market is open to japanese products asked after his testimony if this meant the united states would close its markets to japan if they did not open theirs baldrige said i m not prepared to say that but it certainly would be one of the alternatives studied baldrige said in his testimony japan had a closed supercomputer market and a restricted telecommunications market i can only conclude that the common objective of the japanese government and industry is to dominate the world electronics market given the importance of this market to u s industry in general and our defense base in particular we cannot stand by idly he said he said it was these concerns about national security which led him to express reservations over the proposed  uisition of fairchild semiconductor by fujitsu of japan reuter   baldrige says u s to go ahead with japanese sanctions   baldrige says u s to impose japanese sanctions commerce secretary malcolm baldrige said the united states would go ahead with planned mln dlr sanctions against japanese semiconductor exports despite any u s japanese talks to avert the curbs he said in a speech to an export import group that he was sure the united states and japan could work out their dispute over unfair japanese practices in semiconductor but i am sure the sanctions will go in before we work it out sanctions are to be imposed on april he also said he did not think there would be a war with japan because japan had too much value in exports to the united states to risk such a war those fears are unfounded he said he told reporters later that the sharp drop in the securities market was not due to fears of a war but fear of inflation and that the federal reserve may act on that fact market reaction was also due he said to the drop in the value of the dollar although issues did have some effect baldrige said that observers who were attributing the drop in the market to sanctions were barking up the wrong tree he said the market observers will realize this shortly

february or march baldrige said in an appearance before the senate governmental affairs committee he predicted the deficit which was billion dlrs in would decline by to billion dlrs in and in baldrige said he was making his prediction without having seen the february figures but he said that the volume of imports has dropped beginning with the fourth quarter of and will continue to drop in this quarter the eventual turnaround in the monthly figures will reflect the impact of the decline in the dollar baldrige said ealier treasury secretary james baker told the committee that the deficit had levelled off but baldrige said he was more optimistic adding i think we turned the corner in february reuter   baldrige warns of world war danger u s commerce secretary malcolm baldrige predicted

must heed a report issued by a japanese government advisory body in december calling for faster domestic demand to help cut its surplus and restructure its economy i recognise that the strong yen has brought problems to japan s domestic economy he told a group of japanese businessmen in london but these short term difficulties should not be allowed to deflect japan from the fundamental reforms necessary he said it is not just a domestic issue for japan if import propensity does not expand very soon there is a real risk from protectionist lobbies particularly in the u s with whom japan has so massive a surplus he said they may well succeed in securing action by governments which would be highly injurious to trading nations like japan and the u k channon said there had been substantial

expressed deep concern about the way tokyo had handled the dispute and about the continuing imbalance between the two countries i put it to the post and telecommunications minister that i was sure he did not want to be responsible for an abrupt deterioration in the trading relations of our countries which would have widespread reverberations elsewhere in the world howard told reporters he listened very carefully and i have little doubt the message got home he added british frustration over the lopsided balance nearly six billion dlrs in japan s favour last year has reached boiling point over the telecommunications issue howard said howard has accused japan of trying to shut out cable and wireless from having a major role in the international telephone market in japan i want a fair crack of the whip for cable and wireless as i want a fair crack of the whip for britain generally in trading relations howard said we simply aren t prepared to continue to accept the imbalance which has been the position for such a long time post and telecommunications ministry officials were unable to comment on howard s meeting with their minister but foreign ministry officials said foreign minister tadashi kuranari said that british exports to japan are increasing but acknowledged the continuing imbalance in kuranari said he wants everyone in the telecommunications dispute including cable and wireless to be satisfied howard told reporters that britain was actively considering possible retaliatory measures if it did not get its way on the telecommunications issue there are measures which are under consideration if we continue to suffer from the imbalance in our trading relations he added but gave no details he said he had received a reassuring response from the japanese he has spoken with but of course we ve had reassuring signs from the japanese for quite some time he added what i ve made plain is we expect to see action howard ruled out using powers in britain s

european community eec and threaten the global trading system paul channon secretary for and industry said if congress passed legislation to curb textile imports which would hit ec  ments as well as  ments from major asian textile producers the community would have to retaliate his comments echoed those made yesterday by belgian minister herman de croo who said if the bill passed the community would retaliate by imposing taxes on u s exports channon made his remarks at a news conference after two days of talks with reagan administration officials and members of congress de croo was also in washington for talks channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in congress since his visit here last year as congress and the administration tried to find ways to reduce the u s deficit which last year hit a record billion dlrs channon also called for greater ec u s cooperation to force japan to open its markets to foreign goods channon said japan s surplus is causing everyone problems its surplus with the united states last year was billion dlrs and with ec nations billion dlrs the more united pressure there could be the better he said channon also called for increased u s ec cooperation to avoid disputes he said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation earlier this year over lost  s sales when spain and portugal joined the community and its liberal imports regulations were tightened to conform to ec standards but if both sides drew back from the brink that time he said it does not mean that they would do so on another occasion channon added that there is increasing reesentment in europe over the u s tactic of negotiating under the pressure of unilaterally imposed deadlines he said other potential conflicts are already in sight alleged european

sensible to provoke another dispute between europe and the united states jopling said in remarks prepared for an evening speech but some things are clear and they apply on both sides of the atlantic we cannot continue to pile up stocks while world demand shrinks he said governments must not operate farm policies as if they were purely domestic affairs with no impact on others they also have to recognize that they cannot in the long run develop a healthy and stable farm sector on the basis of protectionism and excessive subisdies and above all europe and the united states have too many common  s to make it worthwhile to engage in wars and competitive export subsidies which end by benefitting no one he added it is crucial that the united states and the european community remain friends jopling who is a member of the ec agriculture committee was in indiana to visit several farms prior to talks with u s officials in washington later this week jopling also criticized a recent proposal still under consideration by the ec for a tax on vegetable and fish oils he said his government would oppose such a move because we do not think it is correct that a shortage of funds to

billion at present the agriculture committee tomorrow will begin drafting amendments to an omnibus bill now before the house responding to the republican plan agriculture secretary richard lyng and representative clayton yeutter said they favor a flexible targeted use of eep instead of an across the board program which they termed too costly the republican congressmen also said they will offer an amendment to the bill instructing the u s agriculture department to value the bonus commodities used for eep at the market value rather than the cost of  uisition but lyng said usda already plans to change to market value accounting rather than  uisition value in order to avoid hitting a funding ceiling for eep of billion dlrs lyng said under market value accounting only about mln dlrs of eep

launched by mulroney s progressive conservative government after concerns about protectionist sentiment in the u s are aimed reducing the remaining barriers between the world s largest trading partner  but the provinces are expected to play a major role in any new trading arrangement and some of the provincial leaders complained of a lack of progress on reaching a ratification formula it s my view that we should be thinking about these things right now along with the questions of the substance of the agreement commented ontario premier david peterson who has been highly critical of the talks in the past but newfoundland premier brian peckford said an agreement was more likely to emerge by consensus and there would be no need for a hard and fast formula peckford said it appears canada is

he listed environmental questions particularly acid rain and defense as the second and third most important bilateral issues facing ottawa and washington on wednesday president reagan announced that he will seek billion dlrs from congress to address the acid rain problem some interpreted the move as a goodwill gesture in advance of his annual meeting on april in ottawa with prime minister brian

would like to change some of the procurement requirements that exist at the provincial government level in canada clark declined to forecast the outcome of the discussions what will come out of it remains for the negotiators in the first instance to propose and then governments and congresses will have judge he said in his prepared remarks clark said that the united states has tended to take

tough remedy laws but mulroney sharply critical of protectionist sentiment in the u s said canada was a fair  r and denied the government was pursuing the deal to win unfair access to the american market he said a deal must bring benefits to both sides we recognize a good deal must be a fair deal one that is fair to both sides mulroney said reuter   canada vows to fight u s potash action external affairs minister joe clark today vowed to do everything possible to fight the u s action against canadian potash exports but also warned against raising the alarm too early in the dispute in the latest flashpoint in canadian u s relations the u s international commission ruled unanimously monday that canadian potash  ments valued at million u s dlrs last year were injuring the u s industry we certainly intend to do everything we can to insure that canadian  s are well protected clark told the house of commons in the daily question period but he said the opposition parties should be careful not to raise false alarms too early the case now goes before the u s commerce department s division to determine if a duty should be imposed potash producers from new mexico claiming unfair government subsidies are seeking a pct tariff on canada s  ments canada the world s largest potash producer exported mln metric tonnes of potash last year with nearly a third going to the u s most of the potash used in the production of fertilizer comes from provincially owned mines in saskatchewan in the commons liberal member lloyd axworthy branded the ruling as just another harrassment from the u s and criticized clark s assurances the country s  s would be protected we received exactly the same kind of assurances in the softwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled axworthy said canada s progressive conservative government agreed to impose a pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlier this year to end a long and bitter bilateral dispute with the u s axworthy urged the government to present canada s case to world authorities under the general agreement on tariffs and but clark maintained the potash dispute was another example of why canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateral irritants in the free negotiations under way with the u s what we are seeking to do is put in place a better system clark said meanwhile saskatchewan minister bob andrew expressed confidence canada would win its case claiming the problem stems from low international commodity prices and not government subsidies the reality of the problem and the injury is caused worldwide he said it s caused by a downturn in the commodity price for fertilizer whether it s potash fertilizer nitrogen fertilizer or whatever reuter   canadians urge exemption from u s bill a group

the northeast midwest coalition an organization of u s legislators david cooke chairman of the ontario parliament s select committee on economic affairs said the exemption would help relations the legislation to be considered by the full house in late april would require president reagan to retaliate against foreign unfair practices unless the actions would harm the u s economy currently reagan
