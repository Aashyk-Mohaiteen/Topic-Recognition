exchange rate remaining close to current levels the treasury document said the treasury said the oil revenue shortfall will reflect the oil price fall of as north sea corporation tax is paid after a time lag the statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel difference in oil prices this year will change revenue by about mln stg for the current fiscal year and mln stg in a full year oil production

the oil depletion allowance to pct was probably the most economically promising way to spur domestic production the white house has said it would consider the option although it was generally opposed to any revisions in the new tax code herrington told a meeting of the mid continent oil and gas association that the higher depletion allowance on new oil and enhanced oil recovery would cost taxpayers about mln dlrs a year the option was one of many contained in a report on oil and the national security the energy department sent to the white house on tuesday herrington said of the increased depletion allowance option that is one that could significantly increase production at a very low cost to the american taxpayer he again rejected an oil import fee as far too costly to the overall u s economy reuter   u s energy secretary optimistic on incentives u s department of energy secretary john herrington said he was optimistic about the chances of providing a more generous depletion allowance for oil and gas producers but added that the plan faces strong opposition from some members of the reagan administration herrington speaking to houston oil executives at a breakfast meeting said administration debate over his plan for a pct annual depletion allowance was heavy and strong largely because of some fears that the u s oil industry could eventually become as dependent on federal subsidies as the agriculture industry herrington s proposed tax incentives for the oil industry were issued last week after the department of energy released a comprehensive report finding u s national security could be jeopardized by rising oil imports in response to a question from mitchell energy and development corp mnd chairman george mitchell herrington said the report did not definitively rule out an oil import tarrif we intend to keep that debate open herrington said however following his speech herrington told reuters that the new report shows an oil import fee is not economical herrington said for example a dlr per barrel tariff on oil imports would cause the nation s gross national product to drop by as much as billion dlrs herrington also said he believed president reagan who requested the comprehensive national security study was committed to some action to help the ailing u s oil industry i m quite confident he understands the problems and is prepared to do something about it herrington said reuter   u s officials defend oil reserve sale plan treasury secretary james baker and office of management and budget chief james miller defended an administration plan to sell the u s naval petroleum reserves in response to hostile questioning from a member of the house appropriations committee the officials said the plan was justified to help bring the fiscal budget deficit and to get the government out of the oil business miller acknowleged the estimated sale proceeds at billion dlrs would actually bring down the deficit by about billion dlrs because of the loss of revenues from the sale of oil from the reserves miller said the sale price may end up higher we d sell it to the highest bidder miller said if we can get more we ll take it reuter   u s oil tax break proposal to be examined the white house said a proposal for a tax break for the oil industry would undergo review spokesman marlin fitzwater said president reagan had no position on recommendations submitted by energy secretary john herrington to encourage investment in the hard hit domestic oil industry but fitzwater noted that reagan did have a fundamental objection to tax rises and special tax breaks he said that even though herrington s recommendation did not agree with existing policy we ll take a look at it the review will be undertaken by the president s domestic policy council herrington s proposal was reported by the washington post to have been made in a letter to reagan submitting a study that found the united states would be importing half of its oil by the s threatening u s national security reuter   u s oil tax would not affect pdvsa champlin deal an eventual oil import fee in the united states will make no difference to champlin petroleum corp s joint venture agreement signed today with petroleos de venezuela pdvsa champlin chairman william adams said this was an aspect which was discussed at length during the negotiations but we can say our contract covers all eventualities in this regard he told reuters during the signing ceremony here venezuela s energy and mines minister arturo hernandez grisanti earlier described the agreement under which pdvsa buys pct of champlin s corpus christi refinery as one more step in the maturation and presence of our oil industry in world markets union pacific chairman william cook said the agreement will be beneficial to both sides combining a secure source of supply with a modern refinery and access to markets we are looking to a long term relation  and at a time of protectionist tendencies in the u s congress there are clear benefits to both sides he said adams said pdvsa would remain competitive even with an oil import fee because champlin had invested heavily over the years in adapingthe texas refinery to process venezuelan heavy  s with coking and hydro treating facilities and obtain a competitive product yield therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been a consideration in the negotiations and it remains to be seen what such a fee would represent we do not foresee any impact on today s agreement adams said he said the refinery could run as heavy as venezuela s bolivar coastal field bcf api without any difficultiesand would probably move over time to a heavier diet to take advantage of bigger margins the refinery has a capacity to process up to bpd of venezuelan high sulphur content heavy with an pct yield of white products reuter   u s should reassess mideast policy analyst the u s should reassess its mideast policy in light of its rising dependence on imported oil according to charles ebinger of the center for strategic and international studies the prospect of rising dependence on oil imports from the gulf and the recent revelations of the tower commission report mandate more than ever before the need for a fundamental reassessment of u s  s in the middle east ebinger said he remarks were made in an address to the national petroleum refiners association meeting although in the short run it is difficult to see a direct link between arab anger and threats to oil supplies in the current environment it will be increasingly difficult for moderate arab leaders to be seen as friendly to u s  s ebinger said oil  rs said threats to oil supplies has kept oil prices strong recently although some believe prices will be weaker if demand falls in the spring but william randol analyst at first boston corp said oil prices will hold near current levels this spring there will be no spring downturn said randol speaking at the annual refiner meeting he said there is a pct chance that oil prices could move higher in the second half of the year following an opec meeting scheduled for late june he said he expects opec will extend its current agreement to restrict production opec will renew its production pricing agreement in june because the value of the oil exports of the opec producers has declined along with the u s dollar randol said opec oil exports are priced in u s dollars and the dollar has fallen about pct in the last months randol said u s oil imports

exchequer nigel lawson this week will favour smaller non prt paying fields according to stockbrokers wood mackenzie and co the cross field allowance offsets up to pct of qualifying spending on a new oil field against prt liability of other fields it is restricted to new offshore developments outside the southern basin and yet to gain annex b approval a report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not paying prt due to its small size the relief would directly benefit in prt saving on an existing field the cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators in those fields which have no prt liability the report said adding that the timing of development of such fields may be advanced the government would in effect be subsidising these developments at pct of capital expenditure before corporation tax the report said on fields likely to pay prt in the future the benefit is of timing although liabilities on other existing fields will be reduced immediately liabilities on larger new fields will rise in the future due to the loss of offsets it said in a study on probable fields the report said that when the rates of return are examined the rise for a prt paying field such as miller the largest undeveloped oil field in the u k north sea is from to pct while the rise for a small non prt paying field such as kittiwake is to pct the report added that in fields which pay prt there will be a cost in being able to have this early relief not only will these costs be unavailable for offset against the field s future profits but uplift of some pct on these costs will be lost thus a saving of prt of when field development starts will have to be matched by a rise in prt of at a later time reuter   union pacific unp closes venezuelan partner  union pacific

fundamentally flawed that it provides little or no basis on which to make a public policy decision hair called the department s proposal a reflection of a largely political decision adding we have no confidence in interior to represent the broad public in this area interior wants to open the million acre coastal plain to oil and gas exploration but it said only with tough safeguards to protect the area s caribou and musk oxen it said a preliminary survey showed the region could hold billions of barrels of oil and gas and that its potential as an energy resource would never be known without exploration interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the billion barrels found at prudhoe bay just west of the plain under existing law congress must agree to oil and gas exploration and if it does not act the land will remain a wildlife refuge protected from commercial development hair said interior s report failed to stress the probability that finding recoverable oil is only pct he said interior s study also failed to weigh oil gas fish and wildlife information the state of alaska had gathered nor had the department consulted the environmental protection agency on the possible effects of exploration the federation in letters to congressmen proposed that a nine member commission be set up to study all aspects of the issue and report back to congress in about two years hair
