 advisory role in reviewing requests to export highly sensitive technology reuter   u s house panel takes first bill votes house lawmakers took their first votes on measures designed to toughen u s laws but held over until tomorrow the most difficult votes on controversial plans to protect american industries meeting in closed session the house ways and means subcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issues in the bill whether they will force major foreign trading partners to severely cut their surpluses with the united states the subcommittee is considering a toned down version of democratic sponsored legislation that aims to open foreign markets but which drops last year s effort to force president reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the lawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and will consider a proposal to mandate retaliation without setting specific penalties the legislation faces another hurdle in the full ways and means committee next week before the full house votes on it rep richard gephardt a missouri democrat who is seeking his party s presidential nomination said he may offer an amendment to call for reductions in the surpluses of those countries with barriers to imports of u s goods this would be a moderated version of his earlier plan to force a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the surplus with the united states by japan south korea taiwan west germany and other countries with the largest imbalances my criteria for a good amendment sets a standard for getting the deficit down he told reporters the law changes are to become part of a major congressional and administration effort to turn around the record u s deficit of billion dlrs last year by opening up foreign markets and making u s products more competitive house speaker james wright a texas democrat said again today he expects the full house will approve the bill by may and that reagan will accept the final congressional bill i expect whatever is reported by the ways and means committee will pass we will have a good bill and an effective bill he told reporters the comprehensive bill will include work by other committees to ease export controls on high technology to aid u s workers displaced by foreign competition to stimulate research and development to remove foreign barriers and to improve education and worker training the lawmakers agreed that for the first time a u s industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competition if they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to the country s economic development they transferred to u s representative clayton yeutter the powers now held by reagan to decide whether to retaliate against foreign violations of fair rules and whether an injured industry deserves import relief they agreed to make it easier for a company to get temporary relief from import competition but agreed the industry should provide a plan to become competitive the administration has not announced its support but yeutter said yesterday i am cautiously optimistic that the democratic led house will come up with an acceptable bill reuter   u s house panel votes to ease export controls a key house panel voted to greatly ease government controls on exports as several house committees moved rapidly toward approval of major changes in laws they hope will help solve u s woes the house foreign affairs subcommittee on international economic policy voted to direct the administration to cut the list of controlled exports by per cent by removing items no longer considered important to u s military security industries had complained they were losing sales to foreign competitors who were allowed to export freely products u s companies could not sell abroad the issue has been the subject of administration debate the commerce department had held that unnecessary restrictions impeded u s exports while the defense department said current controls should be retained but better administered four congressional panels met today to consider portions of a wideranging bill that intends to help u s companies sell more products abroad and to fight unfair foreign practices their separate proposals some of them conflicting will be woven by house democratic leaders into a final bill for a vote by the full house in late april sparked by the proposal of fujitsu ltd to take controlling in schlumberger ltd s fairchild semiconductor corp the house energy and commerce subcommittee on commerce voted to expand reagan s authority to block foreign takeovers of u s companies reagan would be able to block any takeover found to be damaging to u s economic or national security  s we are losing our semiconductors which are at the heart of our national security subcommittee chairman james florio a new jersey democrat said the subcommittee also called for the administration to consider retaliation against japan for its restrictive government procurement practices the retaliation could be triggered by a requirement that the administration investigate whether u s companies were treated unfairly and whether they have been barred from bids on lucrative public works projects such as the eight billion dlr kansai airport construction u s firms have complained they were not allowed to bid on its construction at the urging of the u s recording industry the subcommittee agreed to bar imports of a new japanese product digital audio recorders meeting in closed session the house ways and means committee agreed to allow president reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that refuse to open their markets to u s telecommunications products congressional aides said the committee also agreed u s companies would be allowed to press for relief from imports of counterfeit products made in violation of u s copyright and patent laws reuter   u s japan not in war yeutter says the united states and japan are not involved in a war despite u s sanctions announced last week against japanese semiconductors u s representative clayton yeutter said in my judgement we re not even close to a war yeutter told a house agriculture committee hearing yeutter said if japan takes action to honor its agreement with the u s on semiconductor then the retaliatory response will last a relatively short period yeutter said japan must stop dumping chips in third countries and buy more american computer chips reuter   u s japan war not in uk s lawson u k chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said the united states and japan must work to avert a possible war and he added that a war would not be in the  s of britain lawson told journalists that the prospects for the u k economy look very very good providing we can avoid a war he stressed that a heavy responsiblity in different ways lies on japan and the united states to ensure that we do avoid such a war asked whether he believed such a war could be averted lawson replied i very much hope so britain last week warned that it would retaliate if japan did not move soon to open its markets to outside competition prime minister margaret thatcher gave notice that the u k would fight the japanese government s attempt to prevent cable and wireless plc cawl l from taking a significant position in a new japanese international telecommunications venture but british officials are now trying to dampen anti japanese rhetoric to try to keep developments under control the british conservative government will on thursday consider what legal options are available to it to try to increase u k access to japanese markets officials said reuter   u s japanese open talks on semiconductors u s and japanese officials meet tomorrow to try to settle a dispute over semiconductor and to cut short the mln dlr penalty tariffs president reagan has ordered imposed on japanese exports but u s officials held out little hope that any accord could be reached before the tariffs of per cent up from about five per cent are to take effect on april the customs bureau last week started to levy a bond on the japanese goods that reagan ordered penalized the penalties would be retroactive to march reagan said on march when ordering the tariffs that he hoped the japanese would soon end their unfair practices in semiconductor and that sanctions could be lifted technical meetings are to be held today and tomorrow with meetings at a more senior level scheduled for thursday and friday public hearings on the sanctions are set for april the japanese aides here for the technical talks include shigeru muraoka director general of international policy of the ministry of international and industry miti and masashi yamamoto deputy director general of the information and machinery bureau meeting with them will glen fukushima director of the japan office of the u s representative s office and jim gradoville of representative s office of industry and services the two sides in the thursday and friday talks will be headed by deputy u s representative michael smith and miti vice minister makoto kuroda reuter   u s official sees evidence of export growth beryl sprinkel chairman of the white house council of economic advisers said he sees growing but incomplete evidence that u s export volumes are finally strengthening in remarks prepared for a speech today in los angeles sprinkel said the decline in the dollar s value since had largely restored u s cost competitiveness in world markets and appeared to signal an end to u s imbalances i am confident that further improvements in our performance will contribute significantly to u s growth in he said reuter   u s official to visit japan as row grows undersecretary of state michael armacost will visit tokyo next week for meetings with high level officials that will include talks on the growing row over japanese semiconductor electronics products he is the first high level u s official to visit japan since president reagan announced last week plans to impose tariffs worth up to mln dlrs on japanese electronic goods on april in retaliation for tokyo s alleged failure to live up to a pact on microchip signed last september deputy state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said the trip is set for april to u s japanese talks of this kind are regularly held each year at this time she told reporters the armacost discussions with deputy foreign minister ryohei murata and other senior japanese officials will focus on u s japanese foreign aid programs and political security issues of mutual concern she added although an exchange of views on bilateral relations is expected the talks are not directly related to u s japanese relations she insisted but in response to questions oakley acknowledged that will be discussed japan s billion dlrs surplus with the united states last year has come under fire in congress which is concerned about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the record billion dlrs u s deficit in reuter   u s senate leaders see no war brewing the senate s democratic and republican leaders praised president reagan for retaliating against japan for violating a semiconducter accord but dashed cold water on ideas it was the first shot in a war senate democratic leader robert byrd and republican leader bob dole both told the senate reagan s decision was long overdue and urged japan to open its markets to u s goods and stop dumping on world markets each noted in separate speeches that they saw no war over the issue despite concerns in financial markets that fear has no basis in fact byrd said reuter   u s senate panel could consider measure the u s senate agriculture committee may take up a bill tomorrow that would strengthen the activities of u s agricultural teams in selected developing countries committee staff said the measure sponsored by committee chairman patrick leahy d vt and sen john melcher d mont would establish teams of between six and nine persons drawn from federal agencies and private voluntary organizations staff said the missions would seek to generate in the u s government s food donation and commercial programs pl section export credit and export enhancement and upon return be required to advocate extension of concessional or commercial benefits to  ed countries the teams would be made up of representatives of the u s agriculture department state department the agency for international development and private voluntary organizations such as u s wheat associates the bill would require teams within six months to visit seven countries mexico philippines indonesia india bangladesh senegal and nigeria within one year after passage of the measure another eight countries would have to be visited peru kenya the dominican republic costa rica malaysia venezuela tunisia and morocco other countries could be added to the list senate staff members said the bill still in the drafting stages had broad support and was expected to be approved by the committee tomorrow reuter   u s senate leader concerned about canada the chairman of the u s senate committee with jurisdiction over said he was concerned about a resolution on bilateral negotiations adopted by the canadian house of commons last week the resolution supports negotiation of a bilateral trading agreement with the united states while protecting canadian political sovereignty social programs agricultural marketing systems the auto industry and canada s cultural identity senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen said the resolution may jeopardize the viability of the proposed free agreement between the two countries which are each other s largest trading partners we need a truly free agreement which means both countries have to work toward a deal that is mutually beneficial and comprehensive a large agreement the texas democrat said in a statement i do not question canada s right to protect its political sovereignty or cultural identity however if these phrases mean the government of canada means to take important economic issues off the table in these negotiations i am deeply concerned he added bentsen said canada restricts different ways while the united states uses only six restriction methods he said if canada proposes an agreement where both countries get rid of six methods of restriction it would not be fair and might not win senate approval i am deeply concerned that when the president visits prime minister brian mulroney next month he will be presented with this kind of argument and i hope he makes it clear as i did when i was in canada that only a mutually beneficial agreement will be successful bentsen said reagan and mulroney are scheduled to meet april in ottawa bentsen urged mulroney to withdraw a proposal that would ban imports of independently produced films into canada by non canadians which the senator called a protectionist measure reuter   u s senators say sanctions likely on microchips the united states will likely impose sanctions soon on imports of japanese microchips senators said today after a private meeting with commerce secretary malcolm baldrige although the senators said baldrige told them no decision would be taken until a final determination is made on whether japanese microchips were dumped in the united states they said they were virtually sure japan would face penalties president reagan s policy advisory group of which baldrige is a member will meet on the issue wednesday i am confident we will see action taken sen john mccain an arizona republican told reporters i am expecting sanctions at least and even more than sanctions sen pete domenici a new mexico republican said the senators several congressmen and u s semiconductor industry representatives met with baldrige and state department officials to discuss japan s alleged violations of a september agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the united states and other countries they recommended japanese firms be penalized through tariffs or import duties over the next six to months for continuing to dump microchips the violations were worth mln dls to the japanese semiconductor industry they said asked if baldrige intended to recommend sanctions sen pete wilson told reporters the clear import of what he said is that there will be japan can t just say they will comply we think sanctions must be applied for past violations of the agreement the california republican said the semiconductor industry produces microprocessor chips which are used in high technology products ranging from radios to defence missile guidance systems sen james mcclure an idaho republican said baldrige told them the administration had not made a final determination that japanese companies had dumped semiconductor microchips below the cost of production in the united states or other countries but mcclure said senators told him there is no doubt dumping is going on based on evidence such as invoices of purchases of the japanese products the two countries signed a pact last september in which japan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the united states and other countries below production costs and to allow the u s semiconductor industry access to the japanese market in return the united states waived its right to impose import duties on the japanese microchips japanese officials have said they have lived up to the pact and have asked japanese chip makers to further slash output to save the pact japan has frequently been the target of congressional discouragement over last year s record billion dlr deficit tokyo had a billion dlr surplus with the united states last year and had large surpluses with other countries the senate yesterday unanimously passed a resolution calling for action against japan for violations of the pact since september the resolution will be introduced in the house next week by rep bob matsui a california democrat reuter   u s stock market overreacts to tariffs yeutter u s representative clayton yeutter said the stock market overreacted to a u s decision last week to proceed with tariffs on some japanese computer products speaking to reporters prior to testifying at a house agriculture committee hearing yeutter said it is difficult to comprehend that a decision affecting only mln dlrs in goods caused the stock market collapse yesterday i have a hunch a lot of other things were involved in that stock market fall including simple profit taking yeutter said yeutter said japan would be sending a senior official from its ministry to washington next week for talks on the computer chip dispute we will be glad to have him here but that s not going to affect a decision that s already been made yeutter said the decision announced last week would apply higher tariffs on a range of japanese products in retaliation for the alleged failure of tokyo to honor an agreement with the u s on semiconductor reuter   u s tells japan to do more to cut surplus u s undersecretary of state for economic affairs allen wallis said he had urged japan to do much more to reduce its large surplus with the united states our central message to japan this week was that while we have made progress in some areas much needs to be done he told a press conference after three days of talks what we need is a resolution of issues we need visible efforts to restructure the economy to encourage more imports and we need greater domestic led growth forecasting sluggish economic growth in japan this year wallis urged tokyo to stimulate domestic demand to help reduce its surplus which hit a record billion dlrs in he named several areas of particular concern to washington computer microchips supercomputers kansai airport agricultural products and car telephones he warned that the u s japan agreement governing in semiconductors was in jeopardy despite the pact japanese producers are still dumping microchips in foreign markets other than the united states while u s penetration of the japanese market has not increased he said reuter   u s official says japan action foolish a high level u s official said it would be foolish for japan to strike back against the united states for its sanctions on japanese semiconductor electronics products asked by reporters if japan was expected to retaliate against u s exports deputy under secretary of commerce bruce smart replied that would be the height of foolishness in addition he doubted japan could show enough progress in meeting the conditions of the agreement to avoid the actual imposition of the mln dlrs in tariffs on april japan s billion dlr surplus with the united states last year has come under fire in congress concerned about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the record billion dlrs u s deficit in president reagan s sanctions decision won praise today from the two democratic leaders of congress i think it s about time senate democratic leader robert byrd of west virginia told reporters house speaker jim wright of texas told reporters before the opening of the house session it just shows we were right all along when we said something needs doing smart testified before a senate labor committee hearing that last friday s u s action would help u s negotiations on access to japan for u s auto parts since last august smart has been leading talks to open up japan to purchases of more u s made automotive parts last year japan racked up a billion dlr surplus with the united states in these products both countries expect to conclude the talks by august it s amazing to me that the japanese were surprised i hope it will persuade them we re serious smart said of the white house sanctions the united states has tried to convince japanese car companies of the quality of american made parts and to draw them away from their traditional japanese suppliers all we ask is a chance we have a job to do persuading them we can do better than our reputation seems to be he said measured per car each american made car contained about dlrs in japanese auto parts while each japanese made car contained about dlrs in u s auto parts smart said reuter   u s treasury announces oecd tied aid pact u s treasury secretary james baker said an agreement has been reached by members of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd to control the unfair practice of using tied aid to promote he said in a statement the agreement culminates the reagan administration s effot to negotiate a virtual end to export credit subsidies the practice of other governments using tied aid or mixed credits to promote exports has cost the united states lost jobs and lost exports the treasury said the agreement to be implemented in two stages by july would ban tied aid credit among industrialized countries and place limits on permitted aid by developing countries it would also reduce export credits that do not involve aid and reduce credit subsidies permitted for relatively poor countries the treasury said baker said the agreement imposes particular sacrifices on japan and praised japan s willingness to accept the pact as a demonstration of the japanese government s willingness to take concrete steps to resolve important issues reuter   u s treasury s baker opposes tax increase u s treasury secretary james baker said that he opposes a federal tax increase to help reduce the budget deficit and favors spending cuts instead i don t think it s a tax increase is a very good idea and i m quite confident that president reagan doesn t think it s a very good idea baker said in an interview on cable news network s moneyline television program he said u s taxpayers are taxed at a rate of pct of gnp which is traditionally where it has been but the federal government is spending at a rate of pct of gnp baker said spending cuts are clearly the best way to cut budget deficits baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed by house speaker jim wright d tex or other special taxes the stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunate approach to take the treasury secretary said he said the united states has some of the most efficient capital markets in the world and new taxes would impair efficiency on the international front baker said banks must do more lending to developing countries he was questioned about this after the standard and poor s corp downgrading today of the debt of six major money center bank holding companies largely because of their heavy developing nation loan exposure baker said that developing countries must adopt free market economic policies such as in the united states he said capital flows will be required to support the needed reforms in the economic systems of those countries the money must come either through equity or debt and baker said that developing nations investment regimes do not support enough equity investment so you ve got to have some debt there commenting on the u s deficit baker said i think you re going to see a to billion dlr reduction this year reuter   u s urges surplus nations to boost growth leading industrial nations will be reviewing the paris agreement to stabilize exchange rates foster increased worldwide growth and reduce imbalances but the u s thinks the accord has been successful so far a senior u s treasury official said the paris accord will be reviewed at this meeting it has been successful and continues to be succesfull a senior u s treasury official told reporters in a briefing ahead of this week s semiannual imf and world bank meetings he also said the u s was looking to west germany and japan to bolster their economic growth the official said both surplus countries like west germany and japan and deficit countries like the u s agreed to play a role in bringing about more balanced economic growth he reaffirmed the u s would press ahead with efforts to reduce its budget deficit resist protectionism and boost u s competitiveness the official also said that he expected issues like the dispute between the u s and japan over microchips to be included in the discussions the official made no direct comment on the content or schedule of forthcoming group of five and group of seven discussions he said that industrial countries are concerned that the large external imbalances remain a threat to the international monetary system he added that the meetings will also provide an opportunity to discuss economic policy coordination efforts the official said indicators would be used to measure policy objectives of industrial countries and their economic projections they would also be used to assess progress of policy goals asked whether the u s was proposing a new initiative regarding the indicators the official said the issue would be reported to the venice summit in june monetary sources said the u s proposal envisages using the indicators to make policy coordination agreements like the paris accord more binding reuter   u s wine exports rose per cent last year exports of american wine rose per cent last year to a total of million gallons the wine institute said the san francisco based promotional group said per cent of the exported wine was from california and the top three markets were canada japan and britain japan which edged out britain as the leading importer of american wines in continued in second place canadian imports rose per cent to million gallons japan per cent to million gallons and britain per cent to gallons a spokesman for the institute said the declining value of the dollar and strong promotional efforts on the part of the california wine industry contributed significantly to the increased  ments the wine exports were valued at mln dlrs up from mln dlrs the previous year reuter   uk feb deficit mln stg vs deficit mln in jan official   uk may revoke japanese financial licenses the british government may revoke the licences of selected japanese banks and securities companies operating in london s financial city when they come up for renewal next summer if progress is not made towards opening up japan s markets to foreign competition government sources said we can t say yes we are going to do it revoke licences but this is definitely being considered an official said his comments came after the government was formally urged today by a cross section of influential mps to take joint retaliatory action with the united states against japan britain has grown increasingly impatient with japanese practices there s a sense of urgency here now but the emphasis is on securing not undermining our  s in japan another government official told reuters prime minister margaret thatcher said on thursday that britain would not hesitate to use new powers contained in the financial services act and the banking bill to retaliate against countries that do not offer reciprocal market access she clearly had japan in mind government sources said the u k last year showed a defict with japan of billion stg official figures show a parliamentary motion signed by mps today urged the u k government to coordinate action with the president of the united states and through the department of and industry to suspend all further applications from japanese communications companies for equipment approval by the british approvals board for telecommunications and all further applications from japanese financial institutions for licences until authorities in japan stopped imposing what the mps called restrictive conditions on the bid by cable and wireless plc cawl l and its u s and japanese partners for a stake in japan s international telecommunications market the motion for retaliatory steps came from a cross section of mps reflecting the strength of feeling inside parliament parliamentarians said their action would increase pressure on the conservative government to take firm action officials said another option now being considered by the u k is to refuse issuing new banking licences to japanese institutions that could be done under the government s proposed banking bill now moving through parliament japanese financial institutions are authorised to deal in london of which are banks in tokyo london based firms are authorised to do financial business officials said the new financial services and banking acts offer britain an alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise denied under legally binding international agreements the financial services act gives and industry secretary paul channon power to stop firms from engaging in investment banking and insurance one official said this point has been made to the japanese at official level a number times the official added britain and france are now working together to urge that the european community take collective action against japan but by working within ec treaties another official said british minister alan clark said this week in a radio interview that the european community should build barriers against japanese imports through certification procedures similar to those facing european exporters in japan there comes a point where you cannot resist any longer he said adding such barriers can t be put in place overnight clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible strikes at the basis of whether british industry is to have a fair access to an extremely large market japan which is itself in a very dominant position in certain aspects of our own domestic market it is really a question of fairness the situation is only likely to worsen following news that japan s surplus with the rest of the world rose by more than pct in february year on year to billion dlrs from billion in january political sources said but clark said in his interview that the issues of visible and access to financial markets should be kept separate should britain decide to act against japanese financial institutions it would most likely focus on the smaller rather than larger ones to minimise any risks to its role as a global business centre government sources said japan s four largest securities houses are members of the london stock exchange in washington white house officials said president reagan was ready to impose retaliatory action against japan for breaking its semiconductor agreement with the united states there was no immediate indication when reagan might act on the recommendations of his economic policy council to curb japanese exports to the united states but officials said the move could come today or early next week sources said the actions being weighed by reagan included tariffs on a wide variety of japanese exports which use semiconductors reuter   uk minister looks to ease tension with japan the u k government hopes for a breakthrough on the deadlock with japan over policies during next week s visit to tokyo by corporate affairs minister michael howard political sources said howard who leaves for japan tomorrow told reuters he will try to promote understanding on issues during his visit meanwhile britain will re examine a letter from japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone promising personal help in solving the row over a u k firm s bid to win a significant role in japan s telecommunications market government sources said tensions have risen following britain s decision to arm itself early with new statutory powers which it says could be used against certain japanese financial institutions britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter from nakasone to prime minister margaret thatcher seeing it as a signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory outcome to the bid launched by cable and wireless plc government officials said but this view has since been clouded by reports from tokyo that nakasone s assurances really constituted little more than politeness in the face of british anger they added reuter   unionist urges retaliation against japan william bywater president of the international union of electronic workers called on president reagan to retaliate against japan for unfair practices in semiconductor he said in a statement a crash program was needed in the semiconductor industry to prevent the united states from becoming one of the world s industrial lightweights bywater s remarks came as the white house economic policy council prepared for a thursday meeting to decide what sanctions if any should be taken against japan for alleged violations of a u s japanese semiconductors agreement the pact agreed to last july called for tokyo to end selling semiconductors at below cost and to open its home market to u s goods in return washington agreed to forego antidumping duties on japanese semiconductors but u s officials have said that while japan has stopped dumping in the u s market it has not ended third country dumping nor has it opened its market to u s semiconductors japan yesterday in an effort to ward off u s action ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way to force prices up and end the dumping bywater in his statement said he backed a defense science board task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop new electronic products and manufacturing processes and make the u s industory more competitive but he added the industry could not wait for legislation to pass and that action was required now to help the depressed electronic industry bywater said i urge the reagan administration to take full and severe action immediately against japan by invoking the retaliatory steps that are permitted under u s law and gatt general agreement on tariffs and reuter   volcker pushes spending cuts over bill federal reserve board chairman paul volcker said reducing the federal budget deficit was a more important goal for congress than drafting legislation reduce the budget deficit volcker responded when asked by a member of the senate banking committee about legislation priorities if you don t deal with the budget deficit everything else you do is going to be counterproductive he said reuter   volcker says exchange rate adjustment enough to narrow u s deficit   volcker says more stimulus abroad needed for adjustments in balances   volcker says reducing u s budget deficit needed to improve balance   volcker sees no clearcut evidence that u s deterioration has yet been reversed   volcker urges industrial nations to keep markets open to foster growth   volcker urges quick aid to debtor nations federal reserve board chairman paul volcker said that debtor nations have made much progress in laying the groundwork for economic growth but a solution to world debt difficulties was endangered by inaction on new financing there is clearly a danger that adequate financing arrangements are not being negotiated and put in place in a timely way volcker told the senate banking committee the borrowing countries need to be able to proceed with confidence that the necessary funds will be available to them he said brazil has the potential for becoming a leading world economic power but it is in a difficult position today volcker said he said it will take a concerted effort to regularize brazil s external payments the key prerequisite is clearly in the hands of brazilian authorities he said both brazil and its creditors have a strong incentive to work together volcker said regarding imbalances volcker said that it was critically important that markets be kept open by the industrial nations in addition the united states must reduce its budget deficit and foreign nations need to provide stimulus to their domestic economies volcker said we need time for those actions and the earlier depreciation to work their effects he said reuter   west german exports to u s drop sharply west german exports to the united states fell below four billion marks worth in january for the first time since mid provisional bundesbank data showed the figures showed exports were billion marks in january sharply down from december s billion and the lowest since the billion exported to the u s in july this compared with billion marks in january total west german exports to western industrialised countries also fell in january to billion marks from december s billion also posting the lowest monthly total since july west german exports to the european community were billion marks in january down from billion in december and billion in january last year the figures showed exports to developing nations and centrally planned economies also slackened separately commerzbank ag said in a report that the focus of west german exports this year was likely to shift to europe because of an expected downturn in growth in the dollar area this was one of the strengths of west german exports compared with japan which depended in large part on the u s opec and developing country markets it added reuter   white house discounts threat of war president reagan has reaffirmed his opposition to protectionism and his chief spokesman said sanctions imposed on japan were unlikely to start a war we don t want to go down that road reagan was quoted as telling prime minister j ues chirac after the visiting french official expressed concern about the rising tide of protectionist sentiment in the united states later white house spokesman marlin fitzwater defended the new sanctions against japan and said administration officials do not believe this will result in a war it is the first time that the united states has taken an action of this type and it is significant but it is nothing to be alarmed about the presidential spokesman added we do not want protectionism we do not want a war he said fitzwater said the president was forced to act in the japanese microchip case because tokyo had failed to fulfill an agreement to make some corrections noting that there are enormous pressures in the congress and the land for the united states to take a tough stand he said this was a case where we felt we simply had to act fitzwater said the decision to impose sanctions was well considered by this administration and not taken lightly while the white house official held open the possibility that washington and tokyo will settle their dispute he indicated a settlement probably would not come in time to head off the sanctions we are always open to negotations whether it a settlement could occur in time to prevent this the sanctions from going into effect is questionable at this point the spokesman said the sanctions take effect in mid april reuter   white house panel said urging japan retaliation the white house economic policy council decided to recommend sanctions against japan for violations of the u s japanese semiconductor agreement industry sources said they would give no details noting that the white house had not commented on the decision the administration has been under pressure to retaliate there was no immediate announcement on the council s decision but u s officials said it was likely the senior policy group s move on curbs reflected growing american frustration over alleged unfair japanese practices u s officials said president reagan would probably act on the recommendations in a day or so after consulting with aides on the foreign policy implications of retaliation the officials said reagan might delay retaliation for a last try to persuade japan to abide by the agreement reached last july governing in semiconductors under a pact reached last july japan was to stop dumping semiconductors in world markets and to open its own market to u s made semiconductors in return the u s agreed to hold up imposing anti dumping duties on japanese semiconductor  ments the united states said that dumping has stopped in the u s market but has continued in third countries and that the japanese market remains closed the pressure on reagan to retaliate included a unanimous call by the senate last week to impose penalties on japanese high technology products containing semiconductors a call for retaliation also came from the semiconductor industry and from its chief union u s officials said the most likely move against japan would involve duties on semiconductor based goods such as televisions video cassette recorders and computers reuter   white house says bill generally good white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the administration had some disagreements with the bill that cleared a house subcommittee yesterday but generally felt good about the bill generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the legislation i think we are progressing very well he told reporters there are wide areas of agreement there are some areas of disagreement he said reuter   white house unit decides on semiconductors the white house economic policy council made a recommendation to president reagan whether to retaliate against japan for alleged unfair practices in semiconductor u s officials said they would not disclose the council s recommendation but the officials said earlier it was likely the council would call for retaliation and urge that curbs be imposed on japanese exports to the united states the officials said it might be several days before reagan would act and his moves made public the senate last week unanimously called on reagan to impose penalities on japanese exports retaliation was also called for by the semiconductor industry and its chief union both hard hit by japanese semiconductor in a pact last summer japan summer agreed to stop dumping its semiconductors at less than cost in the united states and other nations and to open its own market to the u s products in return the united states agreed to hold up imposing anti dumping duties on japanese
