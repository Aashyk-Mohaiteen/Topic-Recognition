  abbey national said it cutting u k mortgage rate by pct to pct   analysts see early one point cut in u k base rate british bank base lending rates are likely to fall by as much as one full point to pct this week following the sharp three billion stg cut in the u k central government borrowing target to four billion stg set in today s budget bank analysts said the analysts described chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson s budget as cautious a quality which currency and money markets had already started to reward sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and money market rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget measures came through the analysts said lloyds merchant bank chief economist roger bootle said he expected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow this is very much a safety first budget in order to get rates down he said bootle said the money markets had almost entirely discounted such a one point cut with the key three month interbank rate down to pct from last night and it would be rather conservative for banks to go for a half point cut now midland bank treasury economist david simmonds said he too expected base rates would be a full point lower by friday but this would likely happen via two half point cuts this budget is designed to please both the markets and the electorate the implications for rates are very favourable we could have a half point cut tomrorow and another such cut before the end of the week simmonds said pointing to buoyant u k retail data released yesterday he said lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut in income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target there is no real need to boost private consumption he said national westminster bank chief economist david kern said the lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the likelihood of an early one point base rate cut kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully in particular to see how exactly lawson planned to achieve the sharper than expected borrowing target cut before a one point base rate cut could be implemented but providing the budget small print was convincing and i suspect it will be it is entirely possible that we see one point off base rates by the end of this week kern said bootle of lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave the way for an early one point cut in mortgage lending rates this would help achieve lawson s lower than expected consumer price inflation target of four pct at end he said u k base rates were cut last week to pct from pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange money and government bonds gilts markets but building societies said they would not cut lending rates until base rates had fallen by one full point reuter   analysts see slow move to higher u s prime rate quarter point prime rate increases to pct by citibank and chase manhattan bank today will be followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of the federal reserve s policy intentions economists said based on the spread between banks cost of funds and the prime rate it probably makes sense for others to follow but no rush is likely said paul mcculley of e f hutton and co citibank s surprise base rate increase quickly followed by chase sent u s bond prices lower and the dollar higher mcculley said that once the spread between three month certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than percentage points there is a strong chance of a prime rate increase it has been under points recently however banks are likely to hold rate increases until they see what the fed intends to do about rates in the near term analysts said they noted that banks historically like to follow fed rate movements rather than lead them for example the last prime rate increase occurred in june when banks lifted the rate to pct from pct after a fed discount rate increase in april of that year major banks had been posting a pct prime rate since last august when they lowered the rate from eight pct shortly after the fed s half point discount rate cut to the current pct level on august the banks will not rush to raise their prime rates there should be a split prime for a while with some posting a pct rate and others pct said david jones of aubrey g lanston and co jones said the federal open market committee at today s meeting voted no change in fed policy but he said the fed may well foster higher rates soon jones said that while the fomc probably voted no policy change today it may have decided to apply slight upward rate pressure later if the dollar weakens inflation pressures heat up or the economy shows sign of strong recovery the fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to tighten policy when they did today s coupon pass said joseph liro of s g warburg and co in a move that came a day earlier than most expected the fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by offering to buy all maturities of treasury notes and bonds for its own account this seasonal reserve add is called a pass the fed demonstrated that there has been no policy change said elizabeth reiners economist at dean witter reynolds inc she said the spread between banks cost of funds and the prime rate is now around basis points compared with a basis point average in reiners said the spread is not really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate increase the dean witter economist said that today s prime rate rise may have been less a response to rates than an attempt to enhance the balance sheet bottom line reiners said that given recent problems with loans to developing countries large money center banks with heavy exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans the federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money to one another could help determine how many banks match the higher prime rate and also how quickly they move in raising their prime rates banks cited a higher cost of funds in the three business days through monday the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly pct but quarter end pressures helped push up funds the fed funds rate was extremely volatile today reflecting demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the close of the japanese fiscal year funds  d between five and pct once the special distortions end analysts said the funds rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the pct area they said that if it stabilizes near there banks may not quickly boost their prime rates but a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many that the fed was fostering somewhat higher rates to help the dollar then banks would lift prime rates quickly reuter   anz bank in n z

fall at least a quarter of a point or even half a point if german rates dropped further vak noted that inflation had fallen below one pct a widening gap between austrian rates and cheaper west german

head of the erste oesterreichische spar casse bank told reuters that no cut should be made unless west german rates came down first banking sources said no bank seemed ready to lower rates alone and

he is ready to see before acting paul temperton chief economist at merrill lynch europe ltd estimated that the government wanted to see the weighted index about pct even after this action over the last few weeks sterling s only just within striking distance of that range he said other analysts agree that the government probably has some broad target range around this area however they said lawson would be prepared to see the pound go higher at least in the short term despite the risk of a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports if the bank of england keeps the rates as they are what s to stop it going higher said john cox executive director of ebc amro bank ltd a major operator on the london foreign exchange market cox estimates that the bank of england has been active selling sterling over the past few days despite the lack of general market talk of such intervention and this has helped keep it below dlrs the pound rose to dlrs from yesterday and february the day after the paris meeting but cox says the government must be worried with sterling heading toward marks and would be very concerned if it holds around these levels he warned the bank may run the risk of missing the rate boat if rates don t come down the
