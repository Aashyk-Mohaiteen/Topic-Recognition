relatively narrow trading range of the last months financial analysts said people don t seem to have any firm conviction about the current strength of the economy or about the federal reserve doing anything said drexel burnham lambert analyst norman mains the narrow range trading is also taking its toll on trading volume he noted we ve had a decline in activity as recent economic statistics have not greatly changed people s viewpoints on rates mains said the data which has provided not clear cut view of the economy coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchange markets after the paris initiative has made for less than ebullient market action mains said he added however that treasury bond futures could be in for a retracement after the recent rise as they are near the top of the

of little to the market said kleinwort benson chief financial economist sam kahan still forecasts for first quarter gnp could play a role in the direction of bond prices over the next month kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth is around three pct due largely to a buildup in inventories reflected in the january inventory data friday which showed the largest increase since the key question will be not whether there is a large increase in first quarter gnp but whether any increase is sustainable or a one shot deal kahan said he said that a sizable increase in first quarter gnp stemming from an increase in inventories will be a drag on second quarter growth if that is the case gnp in the second quarter could ease back to a one to two pct growth rate kahan said reuter

to pressure and allow a half point cut today s one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market as a move by the bank to eradicate hopes for a further early rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling most market participants believe that lawson will now foster a further half point rate reduction at the time of the budget although one or two said they would not be surprised to see a full point decline at this stage dealers noted that as part of the authorities attempts last week to ease pressure for lower rates the bank had issued a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the government bond market to the surprise of most participants the issue was sold out within hours of becoming available for trading and the market pushed on to register further sharp gains dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as rapidly as last week s however they noted that although sterling had edged down

dollar the market s overriding concern of late rose sharply on the news citibank cited the higher cost of money especially in the euromarket as the reason for raising its prime rate part of this rise

administration official said the official s comments also suggest that debtors pleas for rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms in addition he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a megabank where third world debt would be pooled and suggested the administration would support such a plan even though it was not formally proposing it at the same time however the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground the philippine proposal together with argentine suggestions that exit bonds be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy would help to underpin the flagging role of private
