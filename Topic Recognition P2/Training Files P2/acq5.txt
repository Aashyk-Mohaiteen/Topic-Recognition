commerce secretary malcolm baldrige that the ministry does not object to foreign participation by those u s firms that have expressed but it does oppose any foreign international telecommunications

reuters u s commerce secretary malcolm baldrige has asked the white house to consider blocking the sale of fairchild semiconductor corp to japan s fujitsu ltd itsu t u s officials said yesterday baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave the u s military dependent on a foreign company for vital high technology equipment pentagon officials said defence secretary caspar weinberger also opposes to the sale u s officials have also said the sale would give fujitsu a powerful role in the u s market for supercomputers while japan s supercomputer market remains closed to u s sales takemoto said national security should not be an issue since the planned purchase of fairchild from its current owner schlumberger ltd slb does not include fairchild s main defence related division in addition takemoto said tension over the supercomputer should not affect the sale as fairchild does not make supercomputers analysts noted that fairchild does make sophisticated microchips used in supercomputers fujitsu makes similar chips and supplies them to u s supercomputer makers they said takemoto also dismissed u s fears that the proposed takeover would violate u s antitrust law saying the purchase would not result in fujitsu monopolising the u s semiconductor market two separate issues appear to have come together to boost pressure to block the purchase industry analysts said the move is in part an attempt to force japan to open its domestic market to more u s supercomputer sales they said u s officials have repeatedly charged that the japanese public sector is closed to u s supercomputer sales despite u s firms technological lead in the field the united states believes japan will only react when bullied and this is a bullying ploy salomon brothers asia analyst carole ryavec said however the analysts said more is at stake than supercomputer sales as the u s fears it is losing its vital semiconductor industry to japanese competitors the real issue is xenophobia in the u s silicon valley said tom murtha of brokerage james capel and co u s japanese tension over the semiconductor has failed to subside despite recent efforts by japan s ministry of international and industry miti to get japanese firms to abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricing and opening japan s market a miti official said that while japan is faithfully abiding by the agreement problems remain in halting the sale of microchips in europe and southeast asia at prices below those set by the pact it is only a matter of time before we solve this problem he told reuters

denshin denwa co kdd after the market was deregulated in watanabe said the post and telecommunications ministry wanted only one competitor for the time being because of the size of the japanese

that even the largest shareholders could own only some five pct cable and wireless and japanese trading house c itoh and co each have a pct stake in the idc consortium while pacific telesis and

that s off the table in terms of creative thinking about ways to sell cars says david cole analyst with the university of michigan s transportation research institute the retail car market is much more freeform now than it was in the year things began to change says detroit analyst arvid jauppi of arvid jauppi and associates thirty years ago in the situation was different dealer s sold one kind

germany s volkswagen beatle began to gain popularity the bug caused a rebellion among dealers who demanded greater freedom from restrictions placed on them by the major american automakers says jauppi

against each other it used to be a chevrolet dealer was a chevrolet dealer now a chevrolet dealer might handle several lines jauppi says as dealers get bigger industry officials are talking about the possibility that some of them might become publicly owned or open international operations offering shares to the public is an option large dealers are obviously thinking of very seriously says cole although some say the franchise system might get in the way of a public offering jauppi says there are few obstacles to trading in car dealer shares dealers are large enough now to go public the only thing the manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those cars it could happen any time jauppi says if you look at the whole merger mania and look at the scale some of these dealers it s going to be very hard to resist taking them public said another analyst and jauppi says that dealer s can be expected to become international we re going to have international dealers dealer networks that are worldwide he says u s dealers will be attracted particularly to europe where the market will expand faster than the u s he says it s not totally off the wall says cole reuter   meridian energy
