prices in the industry simply because of the competition the phone industry giant faces you probably wouldn t see as much of a price decline said gartner group analyst fritz ringling but you wouldn t see a rise grubman said the proposals will allow att to selectively raise or lower prices depending on the market it will give att a lot more flexibility he said att now faces a period of comment in which a number of companies will be able to respond to the proposals in fcc hearings it may face at least one strong opponent u s sprint the long distance joint venture between gte corp gte and united

l subsidiary was becoming a significant competitor odgers said mercury was seeking to make inroads into some of british telecom s most profitable areas one company official privately estimated that british telecom still had a pct share of the u k telecommunications market but feared that this could slip to or pct the recent two and a half week engineering strike which lead to some disruption in service could well have encouraged clients to consider using the mercury system odgers said however he forecast that the last quarter s results overall should not be adversely affected by the walkout he calculated salary savings as a result of the strike at mln stg and while loss of income on telephone calls should be limited revenue probably dropped on peripheral activities but on balance odgers said that group s financial strength economies of scale and the fact that it operates in a growth industry will help produce annual profit increases for the forseeable future british telecom will also seek to expand into manufacturing he said adding that research and development expenditure will rise both in terms of value and compared with the current proportion of two pct of overall turnover
