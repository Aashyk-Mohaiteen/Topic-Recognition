by the u s department of justice which would allow the bell operating companies to offer limited long distance services guinn said the company would likely shy away from that type of expansion long distance services is a very competitive business it s a commodity business and becoming more so he said i m not so sure we would be  ed in getting back into that business however guinn generally applauded the u s recommendations saying they would give more latitude for the bell operating companies to expand into non regulated businesses and provide more flexibility to form strategic alliances with other companies he added that while the company welcomes the expansion into new areas it is not currently involved in any  usition talks we do not have anything actively under consideration he

its aggressive global strategy began in the s when other canadian trusts the equivalent of u s savings and loans were focusing on domestic retail banking the company s overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened domestic competition and impressive growth at its london bank operations which attained full british banking powers in cornelissen said last year royal trust moved into continental europe and asia with its mln canadian dlr  uisition of dow chemical co dow s dow financial services corp which included asset management merchant and private banking companies it was a heaven sent opportunity cornelissen said of the dow financial  uisition we achieved in one year what would otherwise have taken five to years to set up cornelissen stressed that royal trust would shun direct competition with major global financial institutions in activities such as international lending and stock brokerage in order to exploit profitable niches overseas in traditional trust activities such as asset management private banking and advisory services he said that royal trust hoped to complete negotiations before the end of this month to sell its london based savory milln brokerage  uired in the dow financial deal the international market is so big and we have such a miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really limited only by our energy and our desire to find more business he said adding that in trust type services we don t think the international markets are well served aiding royal trust s foreign growth are greater foreign investment in north america and increased

for the right opportunities asked about royal trust s plans for the u s which the company abandoned with the sale of its florida bank units cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well covered by hundreds of small regional banks that doesn t mean to say we shouldn t be in the u s said cornelissen that is probably one area that we will probably do something with in the next five years he said the company would continue to emphasize its home canadian market which cornelissen and financial services analysts agreed would remain vital to royal trust proposed government regulations to allow canadian banks trusts insurance and securities dealers full participation in one another s actitivies will mean more domestic competition for royal trust but not drastically more

provisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non performing loans bankers in the saudi capital said the need to build reserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline a little this year but the kingdom s still sluggish economy and legal problems hampering traditional lending operations mean  ings will remain vulnerable one senior bank credit officer said the work is largely done in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions but banks are still going to face difficulties  ing money the sudden decline of saudi arabia s corporate sector in culminating in a number of debt reschedulings has taken a heavy toll of bank profits with first results now appearing for showing a fourth successive year of broad decline the cumulative net  ings of the kingdom s banks had sunk to mln riyals from billion in before world oil prices tumbled of the kingdom s nine joint venture banks which operate on the gregorian calendar year four have already reported and revealed a further profits decline or net loss for at the expense of increased provisions the newest and smallest of the joint ventures united saudi commercial bank uscb reported a net loss of mln riyals marginally less than s shortfall of mln profits before provisions were sharply higher in part reflecting an pct staff cut last year but the bank nearly trebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to mln riyals from mln in other results released so far show saudi american bank samba reporting a pct fall in net profit to mln riyals while al bank al saudi al fransi known as saudi french slid pct to mln riyals both saudi american owned pct by citicorp s cci n citibank na and saudi french pct owned by banque indosuez increased provisions sharply arab national bank s net profit fell pct to mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to mln riyals bankers said there are first signs that the number of non performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in the saudi economy bottoms out few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic activity but one banker said the top pct of the saudi banks are now at or close to international levels on provisions from to the kingdom s largest bank national commercial bank ncb stashed away billion riyals in provisions or pct of its total loans and advances to the private sector bankers calculated between and riyad bank ncb s rival as the second biggest of the two all saudi shareholding banks had covered pct of its loans and advances both banks operate on an islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine although the saudi arabian monetary agency sama has been tightening supervision there is still no standardised rule for declaring loans as non performing bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures difficult because some banks still book non accruing as revenue while others follow more conservative practices in force in major world financial centres bankers generally said ncb riyad bank and the joint ventures samba saudi french and arab national bank rank as the strongest  ers other banks such as saudi british bank pct owned by the british bank of the middle east are disadvantaged by a relatively low deposit base saudi british slashed profit pct to just mln riyals and accounts due soon are expected to show another low figure but the bank has traditionally been one of the most conservative in making provisions bankers said sama has proved it is not prepared to see a saudi bank go under and not only supported saudi cairo bank after its troubled accounts came to light but also made available cheap deposits to saudi investment bank and uscb the banks can on lend these to generate profit but generally banks are awash with liquidity since they are unwilling to risk incurring fresh non performing loans and while banks in more liberal financial markets can attempt to diversify away from traditional lending conservatism in saudi banking has made it difficult to generate fee income from new investment banking products one banker said operating  ings in the kingdom are not good reflecting the caution in new lending the amount of advances is showing a declining trend while the days when banks had ample funds in free current accounts to invest are disappearing as saudi customers seek a better return on their money in the ratio of bearing accounts to current

of pollution from the fire sandoz has not given any figure for claims which have been flowing in from switzerland and other countries bordering the rhine since the accident however the official said the final figure would be much less than that cited in earlier comments he gave no further details in line with fellow chemical giant ciba geigy cigz z which reported last month sandoz profit and turnover were also hit by the falling dollar the official said sales in local currency terms were up by pct with market share increases in the united states and japan but this was more than offset by
