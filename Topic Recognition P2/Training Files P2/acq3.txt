dome petroleum ltd s pct stake of gold producer dome mines ltd continues to be for sale at the right price spokesman david annesley said in response to an inquiry reaffirming remarks made last year by chairman howard macdonald annesley said the company is considering selling its stake in dome mines concerning dome petroleum s pct stake in encor energy corp ltd annesley said encor is a strategic investment for dome and we have no intention of selling it dome spokesman annesley said in answer to a question that he was not aware of any negotiations now under way toward the sale of dome petroleum s mln dome mines shares he also declined to specify at what price the company would consider selling it shares clearly today s prices of more than dlrs a share of dome mines stock are very attractive annesley commented we were considering the sale at the right price at a time when the shares were priced around nine to dlrs he added a price of around dlrs a share would be considered fairly attractive annesley said annesley also dome petroleum may be able to sell its dome mines shares at a premium to market prices there might be an opportunity to pick up a premium on that because it would be virtually a control block in dome mines he said dome mines shares  d earlier at dlrs off on the toronto stock exchange dome petroleum is now negotiating a plan to restructure debt of more

pete dmp said to be pressed to sell encor dome petroleum ltd is under pressure from one of its largest creditors canadian imperial bank of commerce to sell its pct stake in encor energy corp ltd energy industry analysts said dome has pledged its mln encor shares as security for part of its debt to commerce bank estimated last year at mln canadian dlrs and the bank wants dome to sell the stock to pay down debt analysts said the commerce has been slowly but surely moving encor in the direction that might make it a saleable asset said one analyst who asked not to be named dome earlier said it was not considering selling encor energy but reaffirmed the company s pct in canadian gold producer dome mines ltd dm is up for sale at the right price dome now negotiating a plan to restructure more than billion dlrs in debt sees encor as a strategic investment that it does not intend to sell spokesman david annesley said the encor shares do not pay dividends a commerce bank spokesman also declined comment when asked whether it is pressing dome to sell its encor stake at current market prices dome s stake in encor would be valued at about mln dlrs while its mln dome mines shares would be worth about mln dlrs recent strength in the price of encor shares may also prompt commerce bank to press dome to divest its holding in the canadian oil and gas producer analysts said encor s stock price has improved quite substantially in recent weeks with a runup in prices peters and co ltd oil analyst wilf gobert commented the possibility is that commerce bank would like to see it sold at these levels because they can get more for it now than they have been able to in recent years he added encor  d earlier on the toronto stock exchange at near its week high of and up from around six dlrs in early february the company also recently set up its own operating management which was previously carried out by dome petroleum maison placements canada inc analyst denis mote commented dome and encor are actually going to get farther apart so the sale does make a lot of sense mote said however analysts said dome will resist any moves to divest encor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale proceeds would likely go directly to pay down dome s debt to commerce bank i think they ll probably try to hang onto encor as long as they can said bache securities inc analyst doug weber some of dome s group of major creditors might move to block such a sale arguing they have a claim on company assets other creditors generally all want to make sure that something they might be able to get a piece of is not being sold out from under them said analyst gobert another stumbling block would be encor s mln dlr joint liability in loans to dome petroleum advanced by arctic petroleum corp of japan for beaufort sea exploration analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the possible sale of dome petroleum s in dome mines dome mines has guaranteed mln dlrs of dome petroleum s debt and has a right of consent to the sale of dome petroleum s holding presumably a potential buyer of the dome mines shares would seek some type of relief on the company s debt obligations connected with dome petroleum gobert said dome spokesman annesley earlier declined to specify at what price the company would consider selling its dome mines shares but said current prices of more than dlrs a share are very attractive reuter   dome petroleum reaffirms dome mines stake for sale at right price spokesman says   donald trump said he has agreed to purchase crosby estate s

huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas banking the takeover specialists said major trading houses which see their profits evaporating in the heat of increased competition in merchandise all have foreign businesses on their shopping lists among manufacturers car parts makers are under the most pressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto makers they subcontract for as these move offshore the timing is favourable for japanese parties to buy up potential overseas businesses especially in the u s japan s largest market and where political risks are minimal a takeover specialist at one trading company said japanese companies have become among the world s richest after a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed against the dollar by some pct in the past months but the yen s strength which has also raised the costs of japan s exports and allowed its asian neighbours to move into its traditional markets has frozen japanese corporate growth the

excess cash to work domestic rates now at record lows offer little investment opportunity japanese in  uisitions has been continuous but the recent economic factors have become a driving force said a

this is a healthy progression however the experts do not expect the japanese to run the board meetings of any giant u s or european concerns japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a large u s or european corporation one banker said they will expand their operations only gradually a typical way for japanese business a foreign merchant banker also noted there are not many mega deals left to do in the united states a lot of the big deals there have already been done but medium size and small concerns are potential targets of japanese companies the specialists said japanese will be aiming for new businesses in high technology areas japanese companies had used technology and quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate from that trend one takeover specialist said many are watching the results of the first  uisitions if these succeed activity could build the specialists said but few such specialists are going to sit back and wait until the action begins

t to buy pct of its fairchild semiconductor corp and the political furore that surrounded the proposed sale will make japanese companies more cautious in their efforts to  uire u s high technology firms but will not halt such attempts industry analysts said the collapse of the deal will not be a critical blow to fujitsu but it will boost the cost of future u s expansion by the japanese firm said analysts polled by reuters the  uisition of fairchild is not essential to fujitsu s north american operations but it would have been a great boost james capel and co analyst tom murtha said french controlled schlumberger said yesterday it was ending the agreement because mounting political controversy in the u s made it unlikely that the sale of the fairchild stake could be completed in a reasonable time the sale was opposed by the u s commerce department and defence department partly on national security grounds fujitsu s  uisition of fairchild would have given the japanese computer maker control of a comprehensive north american sales and distribution system and access to microprocessor technology an area where fujitsu is weak analysts said the deal would also have given fujitsu additional microchip production facilities worldwide eight of them in the u s a report by the capel firm said it was an entry point a port for semiconductors and a marketing channel for other things said barclays de zoete wedd analyst rick may several analysts said the purchase would not have given fujitsu access to critical defence technology fairchild simply doesn t have key technology that s a thing of the past may said the failure could be a blessing in disguise for fujitsu as it might have had to spend several hundred million dollars to modernise fairchild s production lines capel s murtha said the failure of the deal will doubtless encourage japanese firms to take a lower profile in attempts to  uire u s high tech firms but they are unlikely to stop analysts said most analysts said fujitsu was likely to go the more costly route of expanding its own production and distribution facilities in the u s although some said it could use the estimated mln dlrs set aside for buying fairchild to try to  uire some less politically symbolic firm it may slow the pace of japanese  uisitions but the necessity of expanding their production and design capacity in america remains said capel s murtha the japanese will continue to shop for bargains but it will be harder to find ones that are politically acceptable japanese firms are likely to favour joint ventures or smaller equity stakes in firms to avoid the political backlash that blocked the fairchild sale analysts said they re not going to slow up they re just going to buy smaller pieces because of the political risk said barclays de zoete s may several japanese firms have already taken to pct shares in smaller u s high technology firms such as super minicomputer makers he said opposition of the sort that blocked fujitsu could end up harming u s firms and undermining a trend toward multinational tie ups some analysts said this is not really of benefit to u s firms either said jardine fleming securities ltd analyst nick edwards the pooling of resources in semiconductors is a positive move why should the government step in to prevent it japan s minister of international and industry hajime tamura told a press conference that interference by u s government officials in the fairchild deal was inappropriate this is entirely a private sector matter and not a matter for governments comment tamura said i think it was improper for u s government officials to intervene to the extent they did he said a spokesman told reuters the ministry s view is that international investment flows ought to be free and that such flows are of increasing importance in line with the growing closeness of u s japanese economic ties reuter   fairchild president seeking management buyout fairchild semiconductor corp

exchange of technology and manufacturing agreement with fujitsu ltd if successful in its buyout bid futjitsu withdrew an offer to  uire some pct of fairchild a semiconductor maker after u s government officials expressed opposition to the transaction brooks told the news conference that any purchase would be in the form of a management buyout and not a leveraged buyout he also said the transaction could be financed through a debt issue or conventional financing from investors brooks said management is pleased by a number of investment proposals bought to them but he added the investors must be willing to invest in the future growth of the company and not just selling off assets brooks also said he was not aware of any direct intervention by the u s in an attempt to block the merger i am not

could be strengthened by permitting formation of financial services holding companies involved in areas like banking insurance real estate and securities in a speech prepared for delivery in new york to the bank and financial analysts association heller said i believe that increased diversification along geographic and product lines is the key to strengthening the american banking system he said he supported the idea of financial services holding companies advocated by the association of bank holding companies in which regulation of various bank thrift insurance investment securities and real estate subsidiaries would be handled on functional lines limits would be placed on the extension of credit by the bank to the associated institutions and all transactions would have to be on an arms length basis heller said measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries heller said he would require the holding company to serve as a source of strength to the bank by making a commitment to maintain the bank s capital in other words the bank would not be allowed to fail as long as the holding company has a positive net worth heller also said commercial enterprises should be permitted to own a financial services holding company again with the provision that capital would flow to the financial enterprise if necessary heller said the effects of these actions would be banks that are at least as strong as the corporations holding them in which customer deposits were assured while any incentive to loot the bank was removed

where he said most of the banks are already well managed but might be purchased at a discount because of the depressed regional economy pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move him to rekindle his bid for bankamerica saying only we continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of people continue to monitor and look at us banking analysts however consider another first interstate bid at bankamerica a long shot not likely to happen any time soon pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his billion dlr bid at the nation s second largest bank a very very difficult decision with that decision made however he acknowledged first interstate may now have a difficult time keeping its number four position in the california banking community the competition in this state is tough he said noting citybank s recent purchase of financial service branches from sears roebuck company citybank is moving rapidly to move us down to fifth and wells fargo down to fourth he said outside california pinola acknowledged that security pacific corp with its recent  uisitions in arizona washington and oregon is quickly becoming a regional competitor in areas where first interstate has long dominated security is has been and continues to be a highly profitable and obviously well managed company he said he added however first interstate at the moment has the advantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer and has the recognition advantage of having given its regional banks a common name pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good financial condition first interstate continues to sustain serious loan losses in its rocky mountain states where energy real estate and agriculture dominate the economy asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked he said i don t think it has bottomed out because i think most of the problems are real estate related and the real estate problems are going to be with us for several years pinola said another failing economic sector agriculture in the midwest has slowed expansion of first interstate s franchise operation first interstate has franchise banks that offer first interstate financial services in ten states while a year ago he was considering taking his franchise operation east of the mississippi river pinola said because most of the franchise banks are now in the west expansion into the midwest must come first calling the franchise system moderately profitable pinola said it is going to take a rejuvenation of the agriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speed we were generating before the last year or two on the banking industry in general pinola said he thinks will be another bad year for loan losses with only banks with minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits reuter   first national bank corp to buy branch first national bank corp the newly formed parent of first national bank in mount clemens mich and bankers fund life
