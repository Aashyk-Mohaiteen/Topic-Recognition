market will say they ought to have come down and will sell sterling he said most dealers agree there is a good deal of hot money being invested in sterling money simply attracted by high overnight or one week rates which could flow out at equally short notice however the authorities will hope that at least a proportion of the buying reflects long term investment the last thing they want to do is reduce them rates and have to jack them back up again said richard jeffrey economist at brokerage house hoare govett ltd he said a half point cut would ensure continued support for sterling at least in the near term however most analysts are still looking for a full point about march budget day the bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the budget said temperton the budget is widely

break ranks and lead the way lower were confounded today there was excitement a fall in the weekly treasury bill rate to pct from pct last friday might mean the bank had changed its mind this followed

fought against money and bond market pressure for a pre budget rate cut leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise in its weighted index to a six month high it closed at its best level since september at pct of its value on the index as foreign investors continued to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and the possibility of short term capital gains dealers said meanwhile opinion is divided over whether the bank can stop a cut before budget day march and why it should want to the bank s latest strong signal to the market that it wants rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon when it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of pct to relieve a money market shortage they re really making the discount houses suffer said stephen lewis economist at brokerage house phillips and drew eleven and three quarters pct is way above money market rates this money market signal was apparently not accompanied by any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges talk of which had inhibited strong rises yesterday and tuesday so buyers came strongly into the pound the pound surged to a high of dlrs at the london close up from the previous finish at and marks up from if this pressure keeps up there is a possibility that rates could drop before the budget said jeremy hale economist at finance house goldman sachs international corp some gilt  rs are forecasting a half point cut in the base rate from the current pct as early as tomorrow however analysts said the bank of england will need to be convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re rating rather than a result of short term speculative gains there are valid reasons for the bank to be cautious said peter fellner u k economist at brokers james capel and co markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of a conservative party victory in any early general election and disappointment if prime minister margaret thatcher decides to hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback for bonds fellner said an election could be delayed until mid but most forecasts say it will be this year others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar however analysts agree the bank is largely trying to set the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether the authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable rate move one way or the other to half points here and there some add the bank will be influenced by signs that at least a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long term capital coming into the london market notably from japan they argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet than the dollar given the latters recent sharp falls and current political upheavals in washington the bank may want to see another few points on the weighted index before the budget argued lewis but by then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the bank of england he added the bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting pressure for a rate move before the budget but banking sources said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more than just marking up by foreign exchange  rs meanwhile analysts noted the market ignored potentially harmful news on the front today s figures showing that the current account deficit in was billion stg this was above previous estimates of the current account deficit and compares with a surplus of billion stg in fellner said that under more normal conditions this would have given the bond and currency markets a pause but that they were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals the guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing banks divided as well as the markets privately some bank officials forecast the bank will hold out at least for this week but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow if a move comes before march forecasts are for a half point

bankers said reflected fears of fresh increases in overnight rates the daily auction was the biggest of the year and comes after the previous record set last june of billion pesetas a spokesman for

rates by a quarter of a percentage point to pct on demand for billion pesetas rates stood at pct at the start of the year and have been increased to drain liquidity on rising demand for funds the

bankers welcome spanish reserve requirement hike bankers welcomed the bank of spain s decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks saying it reflected the socialist government s determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity the central bank last night raised the requirement by one percentage point to pct from march saying that excess liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the bank which until now has relied on raising rates to choke off money supply growth i think it s a good measure a senior foreign banker said it s a faster way to get the job done than using rates and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy it shows that the political will is very strong they know that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive and bring down unemployment in the long run he added the head of another foreign bank said that only a month ago the bank of spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise in reserve requirements preferring to pursue its strategy of raising rates but bankers said the high real rates on offer now around eight pct for overnight funds was attracting money from abroad strengthening the peseta and making spanish exports less competitive the government says industry s competitiveness is also being hit hard by inflation at pct last year the rate was way above that of spain s major trading partners in the european community which it joined a year ago to help meet this year s target of five pct it is insisting pay rises stay at that level setting the stage for clashes with unions who say they have made enough sacrifices demonstrations by workers students and farmers whose demands essentially involve more government spending have become an almost daily occurrence but prime minister felipe gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the money market too hard the bank of spain which only yesterday raised its key overnight

billion dlrs of foreign commercial bank debt bankers said gros will meet representatives of citibank the head of brazil s bank advisory committee and of co heads morgan guaranty trust co and lloyds bank plc high on the agenda will be banks complaints about brazil s accompanying freeze on some billion dlrs of short term and interbank lines the bankers said brazil s several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreed last march to extend the credit lines until march as part of a billion dlr financing package bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment coupled with brazil s freeze raised a spate of technical and legal questions that the banks want to discuss with gros they said they face problems because of the freeze requirement that any payment due to be made by a brazilian bank under the facility must be deposited instead with the central bank this means foreign bankers cannot easily switch their credit lines from one borrower to another the requirement to deposit with the central bank has also meant brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lower rate spreads because foreign banks would rather accept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with the central bank it s caused a lot of ill will with the banking community one banker said gros is also expected to brief the banks on the results of a day tour
