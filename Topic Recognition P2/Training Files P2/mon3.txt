the result is that the ec is often divided over policy on third currencies accentuating what the economists say is the system s greatest weakness its vulnerability to a weak dollar over the past months as the u s dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies the resulting sharp rise of the west german mark severely strained the system more as the mark soared against the dollar it also rose against ems currencies less favoured by international investors and as west germany last year refused to give in pressure from several ec partners and the united states to cut rates to slow the mark s rise the ems had to be realigned twice to ease financial and strains within the community two months ago the mark and the dutch guilder were revalued by three pct and the belgian and luxembourg francs by two pct against other currencies in the system the french franc italian lira the irish punt and danish crown another frustration has been britain s failure to lend the ems political support by keeping the pound still a major world currency outside the system no change in the british government s attitude is expected before the country s next general elections due by mid meanwhile the system s last realignment the th since it was set up prompted european finance ministers to ask the ec s highly secretive monetary committee and committee of central bank governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in belgium early next month but economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details they are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change technical measures won t be enough to protect the ems against external factors such as dollar weakness for that we must take the step forward to the institutional level said leo de corel of kredietbank s economic research department economists say the system s fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates if the dollar resumes its slide the ems could be in for more turbulence

robert heller a member of the board of governors of the federal reserve system said commodity prices could form a useful guide for setting domestic and international monetary policy speaking to the conservative heritage foundation heller said a broadly based commodity price index may be worth exploring as a guide to monetary policy in times of rising commodity prices monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices monetary policy might be eased he said commodities are also standardized to avoid measurement problems and occur at the beginning of production so as to give early warning signs of wholesale and retail changes there is no need to react to every small fluctuation in commodity prices or to do so on a daily basis heller said in a prepared text but if commodity prices exhibit a broad trend a policy action might be considered he said heller said using a broad based commodity price index as an indicator for monetary policy would also contribute to stabilized currency exchange rates commodity prices are generally uniform worldwide and prices for them are more consistent than for other types of goods he said he said other beneficial effects would be to stabilize export commodity prices for developing countries by using a commodity basket as a guidepost for monetary policy reuter   fed may supply reserves in the money markets there is a

dattel whom they accuse of causing losses at the bank of over mln marks by manipulating forward foreign exchange contracts the crash of the private herstatt bank with losses of over one billion marks stunned west germany s business community and led to a tightening of banking regulations the losses were even greater than the mln marks announced recently by volkswagen as a result of fraud in

necessary by changes in monetary and other policies bergsten now the director of the institute for international economics said in a statement to a house banking subcommittee the substantial

imports reuter   german banking authorities weigh swap regulations german banking authorities are weighing rules for banks off balance sheet activities in an attempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticated capital market instruments banking sources said rate and currency swaps and currency options are under closest scrutiny and if revisions are made they may resemble regulation jointly proposed by the u s and u k to japan juergen becker director of the bundesbank s division of banking law and credit supervision said the u s british proposals were  ing but declined to elaborate but banking sources said west germany was more likely to produce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals there is no formal plan yet but talks are in the latter stages one representative of the german banking association in cologne said bankers expect rule changes this year all alterations must be approved by the bundesbank west germany s four major banking associations and the federal banking supervisory office talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changes would require a revision of germany s credit law which has been in effect since authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary political process of changing it banking sources said since the beginning of the banking law has limited banks lending to times shareholders equity plus reserves on a consolidated basis but lending ratios do not extend to several newer instruments such as spot and forward currency contracts currency and swaps commercial paper programs currency options rate futures in foreign currencies and various innovative types of rate hedges the sources said the main value of the u s u k proposals lay in differentiating between different types of risk factor and for instance in placing greater weight on currency swaps than swaps but even if german banking authorities agree with some of the assessments of swaps they disagree on how to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk u s british proposals include a complicated series of formulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in swaps whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial intermediary especially when counterparties remain anonymous this is the so called market to market value but german authorities are likely to consider this much too complex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of lending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of the borrowers involved the sources said the weightings also likely if lending ratios are extended to include banks securities portfolios are zero for public authorities pct for domestic banks pct for foreign banks and pct for other foreign and non bank borrowers a further complication is that the more flexible definitions of equity allowed in the u s and the u k may put german banks at a competitive disadvantage the sources said stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of the u s u k proposals could far exceed the intent of the u s and british authorities the sources said one specialist for dresdner bank ag said a long dated foreign exchange forward transaction could for instance be brought under the same rule as a cross currency swap despite the fact that the risk may be entirely different how new regulations will affect foreign banks here was uncertain many have converted to full subsidiary status and applied for a full banking licence over the last two years in order to lead manage mark eurobonds but as their equity capital is fairly small tight lending ratios will severely hamper foreign banks freedom of movement particularly in the growing business of currency swaps if they are required to include more transactions in the balance sheet the sources added reuter   german call money eases after liquidity injection call money eased to pct from yesterday following a net injection of billion marks at a rate of pct in fresh funds from this week s securities repurchase agreement dealers said but rates were expected to rise toward the end of the week a major tax payment period by banks on behalf of customers payments for the federal railways loan stock and repayments of mark liabilities incurred by foreign central banks with the bundesbank in the framework of the european monetary system ems are likely to significantly burden the system banks built up minimum reserves today ahead of the expected outflow the bundesbank credited banks with a gross billion marks but some billion left the system at the same time as an earlier securities repurchase pact matured dealers estimated the ems related outflow as high as six billion marks the bundesbank declined to comment but a spokesman said yesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to roll over the possibility that other central banks may choose to redeem them meant a net infusion was needed dealers forecast tax payments of and billion marks but much of it is expected to burden the system only next week banks minimum reserve holdings at the bundesbank totalled billion marks on monday averaging billion over the first nine days of march dealers said although the figure was well above an expected requirement of around billion marks the expected outflow of funds was so large that banks might find it difficult to meet the requirement toward the end of march no securities repurchase agreement is expiring next week but dealers said the bundesbank could offer fresh liquidity if conditions significantly tighten the bundesbank wants to keep rates around pct one dealer said reuter   german wage round said to limit monetary options the bundesbank s options for west germany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable future by the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions and employers economists and money market dealers said call money fell in quite active trading today dropping to pct from pct yesterday and below the pct treasury bill rate as a difficult month end approached but dealers and economists said the bundesbank was unlikely to encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for fear of upsetting the current wage round one money market dealer for a major foreign bank said i don t think the bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever happens but it also does not want them to fall above all it wants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes in west germany unions and employers prepare the ground for triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments of growth and inflation economists said ute geipel economist with citibank ag said if the bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the medium term unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands as a result the bundesbank was concerned to make no move that would interfere in the negotiating process geipel said in the current round the country s most powerful union the ig metall representing metalworkers and engineers is demanding a shortening of the working week to hours from the present and an accompanying five pct increase in wages the engineering employers association gesamtmetall is offering to bring in a hour week from july and give a two stage wage increase a pct rise from april this year and another pct from july the agreement forged by ig metall europe s largest union with mln members and the employers would set the benchmark for settlements in other industries such as the public sector banks and federal post office negotiations began in december and unions are hopeful they may conclude by early april ahead of the traditional holiday period in june though many economists said the unions current warning strikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and would not lead to a repeat of s damaging seven week strikes others said unions would not compromise greatly on their positions and there could still be conflict this could extend the length of time in which the bundesbank would keep its activity low key economists said the money market head said the unions humiliation by the protracted financial problems of the neue heimat cooperative housing venture would contribute to union obstinacy the unions haven t forgotten that and they will put this squarely onto the account in the negotiations he said in addition the newly elected chairman of the ig metall union franz steinkuehler was more radical and determined than his predecessor hans meyer and may be set for a longer battle to achieve the best possible settlement for his member  more than engineering workers at firms mainly in south germany held warning strikes lasting up to two hours yesterday
