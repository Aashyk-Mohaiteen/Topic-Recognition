or est gmt today at which senior management will discuss the company s proposed  uisition of the pct of standard oil co srd that it does not already own for dlrs per share the offer is worth about billion dlrs reuter   bp managing director says company does not plan to hike dlrs standard offer   bp says it will tender for remaining pct of standard oil at dlrs a share cash   bp to offer billion dlrs for standard shares british petroleum co plc bp l said it intended to make a tender offer for the pct of standard oil co srd n it does not already own at dlrs a share cash for a total of billion if the offer is fully accepted the offer would be made through its bp north america inc unit and was intended to commence not later than april the offer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares being tendered bp said in a statement the dlr a share price was based on its own valuation as well as those of its financial advisers it took into account reviews of both public and non public information standard closed in new york last night at dlrs down dlrs bp shares dropped on the announcement to p from p at last night s close about a third of the cash payable would be met from bp s own resources the remainder would come from new borrowings partly from banks under a four year committed revolving credit facility and partly from a a new u s dlr commercial paper programme the company said it was in the course of arranging these facilities bp chairman sir peter walters said that the group s investment in standard was its largest single asset full owner  would enable investment and operating decisions to be made without the limitations of a minority bp also believed the  uisition represented the optimum use of its financial resources it was confident oil prices were likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the investment walters added that it also felt that due to management changes in standard could now operate successfully even in a lower oil price environment standard s net assets at end were billion dlrs and in the year it reported a loss of billion dlrs before tax and before an extraordinary item of mln dlrs analysts said that the move by bp had come as a surprise one noted that it was not immediately clear why the group should spend so much money buying a company it already controlled bp could also have bought up the remainder of standard shares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago it was also unclear what effect the tender would have on the u k government s recent announcement that it intended to dispose of its remaining pct stake in bp sometime in the financial year analysts said analyst paul spedding of brokers kleinwort grieveson noted that any effect on the government sale of its stake in bp would depend on the reaction of the markets the deal would probably push bp s gearing up to around pct from pct currently he said however with the likelihood that oil prices would not repeat last year s rapid drop the prospects for standard returning to profitability this year and bp benefitting from its cash flow were good standard was a high cost oil producer the analysts noted spedding noted that it needed about dlrs a barrel to make money and at about dlrs a barrel revenue from production and its downstream activities would push it comfortably into surplus bp initially took a stake in standard following the discovery of oil in alaska s prudhoe bay in bp had inadequate distribution facilities in the u s while standard which was strong on marketing and refining was short on oil the analysts said that bp had promoted a major management reorganisation of standard in the past year the probability that much of the shake up at standard was now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the tender offer spedding said bp s willingness to take hard decisions such as major balance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well received in the markets the lower costs that should now be possible especially after the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come straight through to profits without being cut back by other sectors reuter   bp units seek five billion dlr revolving credit bp international and bp north america are seeking a five billion dlr four year syndicated credit facility in

petroleum co plc bp l is probably the largest credit facility ever arranged in europe bond analysts said full terms will be announced either later today or tomorrow morning bp said earlier it planned a tender offer for the pct of standard it does not already own for dlrs a share cash the financing being arranged by morgan guaranty will take the form of a fully committed revolving credit as announced earlier bp also is arranging a u s commercial paper program in connection with the tender and part of the revolver will be used to support that program the exact size of the u s program has not been decided and the dealers have not yet been chosen the credit facility will also allow the borrower to issue cash advances with maturities of one three or six months through a tender panel which will be comprised of banks committed to the facility despite the unprecedented size of this euromarket facility morgan guaranty said that it was being syndicated only among bp s relation  banks as a result banks were being offered lead manager status at mln dlrs co lead management at mln and manager at mln although pricing on many credit facilities has become extremely fine in recent years

core companies he said the eight core companies will provide directors for the firm the new company shall immediately set to work on the feasibility study of constructing a new cable for itself watanabe said watanabe has acted as mediator between two rival groups one of which included c and w seeking to compete against kokusai denshin denwa co ltd which now monopolizes japan s overseas telephone business the post and telecommunications ministry has said it wants only one competitor to kdd and has backed watanabe s efforts a british source who declined to be identified further said the proposals could open the door to further talks between c and w cawl l and the other firms involved c and w had earlier rejected a reported proposal which would have given it a five pct share in the new telecommunications firm compared to the less than three pct stake watanabe originally proposed c and w has a pct stake in one of the two firms watanabe has proposed should merge the british source said the decision not to specify the exact shareholdings of the core companies could leave the door open for further discussion it s probably a sensible approach on their part the british source told reuters c and w has also been pushing hard for permission to lay a new cable between japan and the u s the proposed merger has sparked an international row with british government sources threatening retaliatory action against japan for what they see as discriminatory practices against foreign firms the sources said last friday that one option for britain would be to revoke licenses of japanese banks and securities companies operating in london the u s has also attacked the original merger plans saying that both rival consortia should be licensed asked about participation by other u s and european firms watanabe said they will not be core companies but if they wish they could participate under the japanese law total foreign participation would be limited to one third it might be wise for c and w to join the new firm which has the support of many influential backers and work within this for the realization of their ideas watanabe told reporters the other core firms are mitsubishi corp mitt t mitsui and co mits t sumitomo corp sumt t matsushita electric industrial co mc t toyota motor corp toyo t c itoh and co citt t and pacific telesis international inc watanabe

chrysler corp s proposed  uisition of american motors corp is valued at about billion dlrs including the cost of  uisition and the mln dlrs in american motor debt that chrysler will assume analysts

outlined his company s agreement with renault to assume amc s debt as well as mln dlrs in unfunded pension liabilities though the latter is not included valuing the transaction analysts were generally positive on chrysler s proposed purchase of its much smaller rival but said they expected the transaction would carry with it a short term dilution in chrysler s  ings a chrysler financial source speaking anonymously told reuters that the proposed purchase price was smaller than it would have been had a deal been struck last year because the impact of the new u s tax law removes chrysler s ability to assume amc s large reserve of tax loss carryforwards accumulated from its losses since there were very serious discussions last fall but we didn t pull it off the source said in a reference to the assassination in november of former renault chairman georges besse it s too bad because the tax benefits fell on the floor and renault could have gotten a much better price if we d done it before the end of last year in addition to amc s debt and its pension liabilities the source said chrysler would also assume any liability from lawsuits over the safety of jeeps which he called an overhang to the company analysts quoted chrysler officials as having told them that the deal includes payment to renault of mln dlrs principal in the form of a year note at eight pct mln dlrs cash for renault s equity in amc s finance subsidiary mln dlrs in cash for transaction fees in connection with the  uisition and mln dlrs worth of chrysler stock to be paid amc shareholders the big number is

deal but the chrysler source said that in assuming amc s liabilities his company will refinance at a lower rate any amc debt that is being carried at non market rates he said there were difficulties

unveiled by chrysler and amc s french parent renault according to company spokesman edd snyder but amc s future to be discussed at a board meeting today would be radically different as a chrysler subsidiary than if it had continued with the state run french car group as its controlling shareholder industry analysts said the future of amc s car assembly plant in kenosha wis and its toledo ohio jeep plant would be in doubt if the overcapacity predicted in the north american auto industry by the early s comes to pass both plants are far from state of the art for car manufacturing sites and amc has a history of poor labor relations at each chrysler doesn t need that many new plants said michael luckey automotive analyst for the wall street firm shearson lehman brothers they probably will close the toledo plant and move jeep production to canada ronald glantz of montgomery securities said that at the very least the new owner of the toledo plant would be able to wring concessions from the united automobile workers union local representing jeep workers the uaw won t be able to hold them up for ransom as they have amc because during a down year chrysler will have underutilized facilities to transfer production he said analysts said they foresaw no major complications that would abort a combination which historians said would be the auto industry s biggest merger since american motors was formed in amc was in need of a financial savior because of its losses of more than mln dlrs since and pressures in france for renault to cut its backing the company had said it could not forecast consistent profitability until at the earliest in announcing the takeover agreement chrysler chairman lee iacocca cited amc s jeep division as well as its new mln dlr assembly plant
