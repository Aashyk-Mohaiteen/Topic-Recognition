reuter   canada banks could see pressure on brazil loans canada s major banks will likely face stiff pressure to declare their brazilian loans non performing if as expected major u s banks take similar action after the end of their first quarter tomorrow analysts said american bankers said last week that slow progress in debt talks with brazil increased the likelihood that u s banks would soon declare their brazilian loans non performing such action would put a lot of pressure on the canadian banks to do the same levesque beaubien inc toronto based bank analyst donna pulcine told reuters they banks like to appear to be conservative said pulcine and if a major bank puts loans on a non performing basis and the canadian banks don t there is going to be a lot of pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is considering the loans non performing and another bank is not wood gundy inc bank analyst patricia meredith said any willingness by a major brazilian bank creditor such as citicorp cci to declare its brazilian loans non performing rather than let brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compelling example for other creditor banks in order to make that strategy work they citicorp have to have the support of the other banks said meredith bank analyst michael walsh at first marathon securities ltd said at least one canadian bank which he declined to identify wants to put the brazilian loans on a non performing basis and is trying to encourage the others to take that position canadian banks are owed about seven billion canadian dlrs by brazil which late last month suspended payments on its billion u s dlr foreign bank debt banks in canada although allowed to wait up to days before declaring loans on which they are receiving no as non performing usually move on such loans within days they could therefore delay action on the brazilian loans until late may which falls in canadian banks third quarter ending july bank of montreal brazil s largest canadian bank creditor said last week it was not currently considering declaring its billion dlrs of brazilian loans as non performing i think that is just for the benefit of the public walsh said of bank of montreal s statement some analysts predicted minimal  ings impact on canadian banks from a move to declare the brazilian loans non performing they said brazil would likely resume payments by the banks fiscal year end on october thus allowing banks to recoup their lost income from what brazil has said it is quite likely the banks will get the money said meredith my outlook at this point is optimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full year s  ings meredith forecast fully diluted per share  ings of dlrs for royal bank of canada compared with in dlrs for bank of montreal compared with dlrs for canadian imperial bank of commerce compared with dlrs for bank of nova scotia compared with and dlrs for toronto dominion bank against she forecast dlrs for national bank of canada against dlrs before a two for one stock split analyst pulcine said she might lower full year  ings estimates for the banks by between two cts and cts a share assuming a possible settlement reduced brazil s costs if the banks didn t receive anything for the rest of the fiscal year the impact could range from cts to cts a share but i don t see that as a likely scenario pulcine said walsh at first marathon suggested however that the brazilian debt situation was so complex that it could drag on beyond one full fiscal year he said he foresaw having to lower his fiscal

for government owned air canada has begun its first serious drive for profitability in years industry analysts said now we ve got a company that can compete with air canada said thomas bradley of richardson greenshields of canada ltd clearly it can go head to head in any market the new airline which arose from the mln canadian dlr takeover of canadian pacific air lines ltd by the small but cash rich pacific western airlines corp was launched last week as canadian airlines international ltd canadian airlines will have pct of the billion canadian dlr domestic market against air canada s pct wardair international ltd is third with about nine pct analysts believe pacific western s aggressive and cost conscious chairman rhys eyton will develop the true potential of the former cp air which floundered for four decades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate canadian pacific ltd they said cp air s management style had been not much different from that of air canada formed years ago because neither airline was held accountable to its owners not that long ago maybe even just six months ago these two airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible neither seemed that concerned about the bottom line said bradley but with cp air being run by eyton it will be very conscious of profitability and shareholder return and air canada is on the verge of going that way he said cp air always fighting for market share rather than profits was a perennial money loser analyst wilfred hahn of bache securities inc said in a recent report prior to its takeover in december it had accumulated long term debt of mln canadian dlrs from to its losses totaled mln canadian dlrs air canada widely expected to be privatized later this year in a public share offering lost mln canadian dlrs on revenues of billion dlrs in it has a debt of more than billion dlrs although only a minority is likely to be sold to the public the prospect of privatization at a time of increased competition is forcing air canada to pay more attention to finances analysts said it recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit in excess of mln to mln dlrs for however this profit recovery was due less to management skill than the fact that all canadian airlines had a good year in analysts said tourists came to canada in record numbers last year attracted by the relatively weak canadian dollar and expo in vancouver which alone had more than mln visitors for the next few years most analysts see three six pct air traffic growth and they expect profits will come from cost cutting and careful spending peter friend of walywn stodgell cochran murray ltd said institutional buyers will be eager to add air canada to their portfolios as a blue chip investment but warned that new competition makes profit growth less certain the airline with something to lose will be air canada at one time it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody else s friend said many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline shares for at least a year analysts said air canada s immediate concern ahead of a public stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes without setting off a political storm it also will be faced with an expensive but necessary updating of its aging fleet of aircraft wardair preferring strong medicine now instead of later already has embarked on a one billion canadian dlr purchase of a dozen aircraft from europe s airbus industrie canadian airlines which has aircraft last week ordered six commuter planes from british aerospace and said it would soon buy as

last year rose six pct from and freight kilometres flown climbed pct though the airline s load factor probably fell to pct from pct cathay added new planes and was forced to fly some routes last year

chairman walter seipp said that from the present viewpoint the bank must expect full operating profit to be lower than in in the first two months of the year partial operating profit excluding trading

still more strongly by contrast the personnel and fixed asset expenses increased german banks do not report full operating profit but seipp said last year the figure for the first time had topped one billion marks for the parent bank and the group result was around pct higher than this commenting on seipp said we were able to raise the full operating profit slightly above the record result of because own account profits increased slightly he gave no concrete details but added that in january and february good own account trading profits meant that the drop in full operating  ings was more modest than that in the partial operating figure the bank would as a result be more profit oriented in future developing for example more into investment banking keeping a tight rein on personnel costs and dampening expenditures on fixed assets turning to results seipp said by year end there had been a strong growth in business volume over the year business volume rose by pct to billion marks compared with seipp added group balance sheet volume rose by pct to billion it would have been around five billion marks higher still if currency relation s had remained unchanged in the parent bank the surplus rose nine pct in the year while the margin held roughly at s pct despite pressure on credit rates the surplus on commission business which had soared by a quarter in rose by pct last year thanks almost exclusively to growth in securities commissions seipp said personnel expenditure was up pct last year at more than billion marks fixed asset expenditure rose by pct to more than mln as a result the parent bank partial operating profit rose by pct to mln marks parent bank tax payment rose to mln marks last year from mln in seipp said extraordinary  ings included a high two figure million in profit from the sale of the bank s aeg ag aegg f shares to daimler benz ag daig f during the latter s majority stake purchase booked last year the ability of the bank to write off depreciations in credit business against profits from securities trading and  ings on the sale of stakes had been utilised as in prior years to its full extent because of numerous insolvencies at home by far the largest part of the provisions were set aside for individual write downs from domestic business abroad the circle of problem debtor countries rose last year although the ratio of credit exposure to provisions improved further seipp said that because about half the group s exposure to problem nations was in dollars the bank had swapped into dollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks this means that no open currency positions exist any longer on the amount of the provision that is made against an actual default he added despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in the last few weeks he said the international banking community is better armed than it was against payment problems all banks had significantly strengthened their capital base most european banks had made considerable provisions against bad debts while goverments and central banks were better prepared for unforseen difficulties he described debt equity swaps as a very  ing new
