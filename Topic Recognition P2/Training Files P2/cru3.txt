energy and power subcommittee hearing an optimal tariff would be one implemented only if the international price of oil falls below say dlrs a barrel on the demand side the obvious policy is an excise tax on transportation fuels krapels said but william johnson of the jofree corp disagreed with the oil tariff proposal saying congress should remove price controls on natural gas repeal the windfall

strategic petroleum reserve at a faster rate richard adkerson of arthur andersen and co told the subcommittee oil imports were expected to increase because funds for exploration and development of domestic oil sources cannot now be economically justified due to low oil prices reuter   energy california oil production drilling for oil in california is likely to continue at last year s sharply reduced levels despite recent gains in oil prices industry analysts said because much of the oil in california fields is thick heavy and expensive to extract oil prices would have to increase to near s levels before any significant recovery is seen in drilling they said companies will probably only drill their best prospects said john curti an analyst with birr wilson securities inc few new wells now are being drilled only rigs about one quarter of the total available were drilling for oil onshore in california last week compared to about last year said bill bolster of munger oil information services which tracks california drilling activity it s in the dregs right now said bolster of the state s drilling activity current prices are not enough to justify increased drilling said ed

prices for california s marker grade line blend have slumped about pct in the last month to dlrs from a high of about dlrs more than half of california s oil comes from stripper wells those producing less than barrels a day and that much of that oil costs between and dlrs a barrel to extract malmgreen said it s not unusual for a stripper well to cost dlrs malmgreen said many stripper wells along the southern california coast produce eight times as much water as oil and inland wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur extraction of the thick heavy oil he said the outlook for future production in california is clouded by a lack of exploratory drilling now analysts said in the heart of california s oil patch kern county which produces about two thirds of the state s oil exploratory drilling has slowed to a crawl only exploratory wells were drilled in kern county in compared to in according to david mitchell of the state energy commission so far this year only five exploratory wells have been drilled i don t think they ll even get to what they did last year mitchell said no pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of the decade mitchell said along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the number of producing wells and overall production between february and october of the number of producing oil wells in california fell pct to from more than said bill guerard of the california energy commission in line with that decrease california s oil output fell about pct last year due to low oil prices and is expected to remain at that lower level analysts said between february and october california s oil production slipped from an all time high of mln barrels per day to mln bpd guerard said total estimated oil production in

of oil as non middle east supplies diminish exxon corp xon director and senior vice president donald mcivor said policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulk of world oil reserves lies in the middle east he said in a speech prepared for delivery to the australian petroleum exploration association apea annual conference it appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewhere will not change this fact he said mcivor said of the world s oil fields contain about pct of all oil ever discovered only of these super giant fields lie outside the middle east and only five of the have been discovered in the last years three of them in the middle east he said he also said that since the world has been consuming to billion barrels a year while making discoveries at the rate of only to billion barrels a year more than half of remaining proved reserves are in the middle east he said mcivor said it was important to continue to search for oil outside the middle east because each addition contributes to a diversity of supply desirable for global political and economic stability it is important to enhance the likelihood of home country discoveries with measures such as non discriminatory and stable taxation and minimum regulation together with opening up of acreage for exploration he said increasing reliance on the middle east will also boost the incentive to use natural gas and synthetic sources of petroleum he added reuter   exxon xon may close one french refinery exxon corp the world s largest oil company said in a published interview today that it was

refineries in france during the interview an exxon spokeswoman confirmed that raymond had specifically mentioned refineries in france but said that no specific refinery had been named she also said that all of exxon s opertations were under constant review exxon currently has two refineries in france fos in the mediterranean with a capcity of barrels per day and port jerome west of paris with a similar capacity petroleum intelligence weekly an influential journal said in its current issue that they understood that exxon was looking at the possibility of refinery closures in antwerp southern france or possibly italy paul mlotok oil analyst with salomon brothers inc said that with the closures exxon made in in europe and the improvement in the european refining situation its future profits there should be good exxon and other major oil companies have closed a bunch of refineries in europe upgraded the rest and shaken many of the indepedents out of the market now with demand for products rising and efficient operations exxon should show superior  ings mlotok said just after royal dutch rd they are seen as one of the highest grade refiners in europe he added industry sources said that the oil companies were likely to feel greater pressure on their operations in southern europe where competition from the opec countries is increasing as these producers move further into downstream operations piw said that refiners in the mediterranean can expect increased  ments from saudi arabia and other opec export refineries piw said sales from libya algeria and elsewhere are expected to

reached a to dlr a barrel price range you re talking about a pct increase in oil prices but i think that time is coming and we ve got to be prepared mcmillan said he predicted u s oil demand would rise by about one pct annually in the next few years while the nation fails to replace its oil reserves through exploration by the turn of the century world oil prices will be significantly higher because of declining supplies mcmillan said ashland oil inc chairman john hall who also spoke at the meeting advocated some form of federal tax incentives to help spur development of synthetic fuels the united states hall said has nearly billion tons of demonstrated coal reserves an amount more than triple that of all the world s known oil reserves we must encourage research now in order to make synfuels competitive later hall said the average lead time for development of a shale oil or liquified coal project is between five and ten years until last year the federal government had subsidized synfuels development through the u s synthetic fuels corp a research program created during the carter administration with the goal of developing replacements for up to two mln barrels of oil the

reserve fill rate capacity is barrels a day herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill rate for the petroleum reserve but the rate had been kept down because of budgetary constraints herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he might advocate but u s officials have shown in tax benefits for oil and gas exploration and for research and development into new ways to extract oil which is now considered uneconomical to produce he made the remarks in conjunction with the release of the energy department s study on oil s impact on national security herrington said that before he
