izvestia says soviet winter crops need reseeding the government daily izvestia said a considerable amount of soviet winter crops need to be reseeded and the state harvest target of mln tonnes will not be easy to fulfil without giving figures the newspaper said a considerable part of the winter crops must be reseeded but that creates extra effort in the fields in spring the soviet union has previously said nine mln hectares of winter will have to be reseeded because of winterkill a u s department of agriculture analyst in washington has said the figure of nine mln hectares would equal about pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in years the planned task of bringing in no less than mln tonnes of is not simple izvestia said this week s sudden fall in

study urges foreign access to farm markets japan should increase foreign access to its farm products market while encouraging further development of domestic agriculture a government report said the white paper on agriculture for the year ended march said active participation in writing world farm rules at the next round of general agreement on tariffs and gatt talks will help prepare japan to improve access agriculture ministry sources said the paper marked an easing in japan s tough position on agricultural imports which stressed the need for strict controls on some products to maintain self sufficiency in food japan now produces only pct of its annual needs down from pct some years ago official figures show the paper said japanese agriculture has been slow to improve productivity and demand supply imbalances the relative shortage of farmland in japan is mainly responsible for higher domestic prices it said the strong yen has meant lower input material prices but has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has worsened working conditions among part time farmers the paper said this could make it difficult to improve the industry s structure the paper said to solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices to more reasonable levels japan should try to restructure the the agricultural sector to improve productivity and make it self supporting it said reuter   lyng says too late for crop decoupling this year u s agriculture secretary richard lyng said it is too late to implement a full acreage provision or decoupling for crops i think there s a chance we ll see that legislation passed but not for crops it s too late lyng told the national and feed association convention here lyng added that there seems some support in congress for and there was a good chance a pilot program will be passed as part of a pending disaster bill but he indicated that it is already too late in the year to alter the crop program sign up for spring crops closes the end of this month overall lyng predicted very little change will be legislated in the farm bill this year reuter   more u s certificates needed study says more generic certificates should be released onto the market in order for the u s certificate program to have its full effect on commodities according to a study by sparks commodities inc the agriculture department should make deficiency payments and paid land diversion payments in a two third certificate one third cash ratio through fiscal year carroll brunthaver president of sparks commodities told a house agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates thereafter government payments should be issued in roughly a split between cash and certificates brunthaver said the sparks study on certificates examined two possible scenarios through the growing season a zero certificate case where no certificate program was assumed and an alternative case labeled adequate certificate case in which sufficient certificates would be released so that prices would not be artificially supported by market shortages due to acreage reduction programs or government holdings the study showed that total use under the adequate certificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenario by pct usage would be markedly more in and when usage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed the zero certificate case by to pct for the five year period examined government expenditures under the adequate certificate case were billion dlrs or pct less than under the zero certificate case the sparks study said that billion dlrs or pct of those savings resulted from smaller government storage costs the study also estimated that government stocks under the adequate certificate case would be billion bushels below the zero certificate case at the end of the period examined the sparks study said that while certificates permit market prices to fall below loan levels these lower prices increase commodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versus cash reuter   no proof of more chernobyl damage diplomats western agricultural attaches in moscow said they had no evidence to substantiate
