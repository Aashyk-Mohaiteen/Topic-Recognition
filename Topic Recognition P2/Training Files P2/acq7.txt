fairchild semiconductor business to fujitsu   schlumberger slb ends pact to sell fairchild schlumberger ltd said it terminated an agreement in principle for fujitsu ltd to buy pct of its fairchild semiconductor operations the company said the rising political controversy in the u s concerning the venture made it unlikely that the sale of the fairchild stake could be completed within a reasonable time the sale has been opposed by the u s commerce department and the u s defense department in part on national security grounds the company said termination of the agreement opened other possibilities including a possible leveraged buyout of the semiconductor maker by fairchild management in the interim fairchild would continue its ongoing business within schlumberger the oilfield services concern said last october schlumberger announced the sale of the fairchild stake and said it would take a mln dlrs charge in the fourth quarter from the sale the company ended up recording special charges of billion dlrs in the fourth quarter leading to a loss of billion dlrs for the year schlumberger never announced a price for the sale but industry analysts have estimated the value of the deal at about mln dlrs the proposed sale was under antitrust review by the u s justice department additionally commerce secretary malcolm baldridge and other u s officials have voiced reservations about the transaction since it was announced government officials have expressed concern that the sale could reduce the competitiveness of u s chip makers by putting key advanced technology into

looked at fairchild and would be willing to buy it among the companies that would be  ed in bidding for fairchild are advanced micro devices amd sunnyvale calif and lsi logic corp llsi milpitas calif industry analysts said top u s chipmakers like national semiconductor corp nsm texas instruments inc txn and motorola inc mot might also seek to buy fairchild but could possibly run into antitrust problems the analysts added moreover fairchild s management is thought to be considering proposing a leveraged buyout of the cupertino calif company analysts said in a brief statement announcing the termination of the agreement with fujitsu schlumberger said the decision opened up other possibilities including a possible buyout by fairchild management the company said it ended the deal in which fujitsu would have bought pct of fairchild for an estimated mln dlrs because rising opposition to the deal by the reagan administration made it unlikely that the sale could be completed within a reasonable period of time analysts questioned this explanation however arguing that the companies did not need government approval to complete the transaction both schlumberger and fujitsu are foreigned owned companies schlumberger would not have terminated the deal because the u s government didn t want it said johnson of l f rothschild a spokesman for schlumberger declined to elaborate on the company s news release he said only that the company was reviewing a number of possible alternatives for the fairchild unit officials at fairchild and fujitsu were not immediately available for comment analysts noted the significance of the government s apparent success in preventing fujitsu from taking control of fairchild administration officials including commerce secretary malcolm baldrige and defense secretary caspar weinberger feared that the sale to fujitsu would lead to japanese control of key semiconductor technology for supercomputers and military weapons systems the government really stood up for the semiconductor industry said johnson of l f rothschild that i think is the real significance of this consequently analysts said the japanese government might now feel

they must extend the period their offers are open if key conditions are changed specifically the agency said those making tender offers for companies stock must extend the offers if they decide to eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be tendered in order for the offers to be valid tender offers typically include minimum share conditions as a result a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached in an interpretation of current rules which officials said clarifies the sec s present position the agency said a tender offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so the interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share condition is a material change of the tender offer under u s securities law sec officials said the sec has already said that other specific material changes such as changes in the percentage of securities being sought or the price being offered made during the course of a tender offer require a day extension of the offer the length of the extension which is aimed at giving shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender offer was not specified in cases where the minimum share conditions were waived sec officials said the length of the extension in such cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding each case but would generally be between five and days the agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each offer denying shareholders the chance to react to the new information officials declined to identify the two offers if a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of its offer it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate dissemination the sec said federal securities law requires that all tender offers remain open for at least business days reuter   sec moves to discipline

an obligatory continuous rating for all swiss franc bonds and said he believed anyone buying more than five pct of a company should be made to declare their share in comments at a news conference of

in a decline in the average quality of borrowers on the swiss franc market and a debate on the use of registered shares to prevent takeovers have made both major issues among bankers vontobel noted that many borrowers already came to the market with ratings from the major u s agencies which were readily available to professionals through specialised information systems we should make this classification obligatory and publish it in places that are easily accessible to lay people he said the quick changing nature of the financial market meant these ratings should also be continually updated he said vontobel also noted that recent years had seen companies worried about takeovers increasingly issuing registered shares and participation certificates rather than bearer shares however both types of issue had a drawback he said the recent attempt by jacobs suchard ag jacz z to take over hero conserven lenzburg herz z had shown the limits of a pledge by the banks not to sell registered shares to someone who was not eligible according to the company s statutes excessive issue of participation certificates which do not carry voting rights would also be contrary to the

company someone s betting this company will go for dlrs per share said one arbitrager arbitragers said the stock is a risky buy at current levels unless an offer was accepted in the dlr per share range they said to make an arbitrage investment at this level would be chancy since it will take a long time for any transaction to be completed because of regulatory approvals necessary for the

doors nippon life can open to the increasingly important tokyo financial markets i think this in all honesty is a preliminary step said long what you will see probably in the future is american express selling an additional pct in the public market and have a public vehicle for shearson long said normally investors do not make a major capital commitment into an illiquid situation he said of nippon some analysts previously speculated a pct stake in shearson might be sold to the public they said the firm like other investment banks needs capital to expand globally american express has said the total employees of shearson will expand by pct in internationally however that number is substantially lower than growth last year a company spokesman said american express officials would not comment beyond a statement made this morning that statement however did not close off the possibility of a public offering or other option for shearson david anthony a smith barney analyst said it is possible shearson would be partially sold to the public but he believes the firm will digest the nippon investment first i think they ll figure out what they re going to do with the money they have he said joan goodman an analyst with pershing and co also said american express could determine to sell shares to the public in its statement the financial services giant said it is continuing to study various plans for shearson in addition to the investment by nippon american express said options under study range from expanding shearson s capacity to meet international competition to broadening

the midwest conglomerate may fall prey to another offer either from gaf or its own management analysts believe analysts also said borg warner may attempt to escape gaf through a restructuring the speculation pushed borg warner s stock up to in heavy trading analysts predicted feisty gaf chairman samuel heyman will stage a tough campaign to gain control of borg warner so he can add its profitable plastics and chemical business to gaf it seems from at least their dealing with raider irwin jacobs that they don t want to be taken over the question is now do they  uiesce to gaf i think instinctively they want to remain independent said dudley heer of duff and phelps borg warner has been under siege by takeover speculation for almost a year last week jacobs investment vehicle minstar inc and an investor group sold its mln borg warner shares the same day gaf corp raised its stake by mln shares to pct of the outstanding jacobs was  ed in buying the company but took no steps toward a transaction their borg warner policy has been to stonewall them for the last nine months it s been one of the dullest corporate battles i ve seen said one analyst the battle however has heated up and the range of breakup values on wall street span from the current market price to almost dlrs per share most analysts said they think a price in the low s would be appropriate arbitragers speculate that gaf will not give up easily on its billion dlr offer to buy the balance of borg warner analysts who know gaf predict heyman will either end up with borg warner or enrich his chemicals and building materials company in some other way heyman two years ago attempted an unsuccessful takeover of union carbide corp but gaf benefited from that company s restructuring borg warner can t quibble that it s not a legitimate offer it seems to me the short of it is borg warner is kind of between a rock and a hard place they either have to accept a dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it s sweetened i personally think the company is worth around dlrs per share said pershing analyst richard henderson henderson also speculated the company might attempt a restructuring such as the one carried out by goodyear tire and rubber co last year when it was being courted by sir james goldsmith the company bought back the financier s stock and carried out a wider share repurchase arbitragers however said they do not believe heyman is seeking greenmail or the repurchase of his stock by the company at a premium analysts noted that heyman seems to have no problems with financing the transaction previously associated with junk bond experts drexel burnham lambert inc gaf said it would finance its borg warner takeover with bank financing gaf said it would make a tender offer following a merger agreement approved by the borg warner board and conditioned on the board s recommendation of the tender offer and merger heyman said in a letter to borg warner that he expects a merger would provide job security for borg warner employees since the two companies businesses overlap analysts however believe heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repay debt from the transaction gaf s stock rose today to i believe obviously if gaf takes over borg warner at the level it is proposing it would enhance gaf share values substantially said oppenheimer analyst charles rose he said at dlrs per share heyman s average cost for the company s stock would be dlrs per share based on gaf s current holdings rose said the borg warner plastics and chemical business which makes thermo plastics is the asset attracting heyman analysts said it accounts for a third of borg s  ings the plastics are used in telephone equipment office equipment and appliances borg has half

gencorp inc gy the surprise billion dlr tender offer for ohio based conglomerate gencorp inc will not be enough to buy the company analysts said analysts estimated the dlr per share offer from general partners is to dlrs per share below the breakup value of gencorp however market sources and analysts said uncertainty surrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges to gencorp broadcasting licenses gencorp s stock rose to in heavy trading the expectation is either there will be someone else or the bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management s cooperation said larry baker an analyst with e f hutton group analysts said there is concern about challenges to gencorp s broadcast licenses for two television and radio stations some of the disputes dating back about years were brought by groups that alleged improper foreign payments and political contributions i think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation said baker of the offer some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issue might be a stumbling block or result in a long period of time for any transaction a source close to general partners however said general partners would apply to the federal communications commission for special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations the source said if approved the authority would allow a transaction to be carried out if it received the short form approval general partners would set up a trust which would hold the broadcasting properties until the licensing situation is resolved general partners is equally owned by investors wagner and brown and glass maker afg industries inc some market sources speculated an outside buyer such as general partners might even be be a catalyst to resolution of the challenges since it would carry out gencorp s plan to sell the stations gencorp earlier this month reached an agreement with walt disney co to sell its los angeles television station whj tv disney would pay mln dlrs to gencorp and mln dlrs to a group that challenged the station s license gencorp also has a pending agreement to sell wor tv in secaucus n j to mca inc for mln dlrs general partners said it intends to keep the company s plastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and related products segment charles rose an analyst with oppenheimer and co said that on a breakup valuation the company might be worth as much as dlrs per share rose estimated the aerospace business could bring to dlrs per share or one billion dlrs as would diversitech the plastics unit broadcasting including assets pending sale might be to dlrs per share he said the company formerly known as general tire and rubber co also has a tire business rose estimated would be worth five to dlrs per share he estimated the bottling business might also be worth several dollars per share he said analysts said gencorp chairman a william reynolds who became chairman last year has been emphasizing the company s aerojet general and diversitech general businesses gencorp founded in became an unfocused conglomerate over the years and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve the management s doing a very fine job in trying to deal with the non strategic assets of the company rose said analysts expect gencorp to resist the tender offer but they declined to predict what steps the company might take they said it would be possible the company might consider a leveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer general partners holds pct of gencorp stock and there was some concern about greenmail greenmail is the payment at a premium for an unwanted shareholders stock i would doubt they would greenmail them but nothing surprises me anymore said rose gencorp has not commented on the offer it has retained

being courted by usair yesterday icahn s transworld airlines inc twa made a billion dlr offer for usair group the move complicated a usair takeover offer for piedmont which was believed to be close to accepting the bid today usair rejected icahn s dlr per share offer and said the bid was a last minute effort to interfere in its takeover of piedmont icahn was unavailable for comment piedmont fell one to on volume of twa was off to usair fell to as doubt spread it would be taken over analysts and market sources view the twa bid as an attempt to either trigger a counter offer from usair or to attract a suitor who might want both airlines once they merged the next move is either icahn starts a tender offer or piedmont and usair announce a deal speculated one arbitrager some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current price of piedmont since it is not clear that usair s bid will succeed piedmont s largest shareholder and other suitor norfolk southern corp nsc has offered dlrs per share for the company usair offered dlrs cash per share for half of piedmont stock and dlrs per share in stock for the balance some arbitragers however believe the depressed price of piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is destined to be  uired by someone usair they said is the least likely to be bought icahn who has long talked about further consolidation in the airline industry also offered usair the alternative of a three way airline combination including twa and piedmont but wall street has given little credibility to icahn s offer which lacked financing and was riddled with contingencies still he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two airlines both of which analysts said would fit well with twa you can t discount him said one arbitrager analysts however said icahn would have to prove he is serious by following through with his threats or making a new offer in making the offer for usair icahn threatened to go directly to shareholders for pct of the stock at a lower price if usair rejected his offer it s clear icahn wants to sell and he s bluffing said one arbitrager analysts said the dlr per share offer was underpriced by about six dlrs per share some analysts believe icahn s proposed three way airline combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles but others believe it could be cleared if the companies are  uired separately twa would have to be the surviving company for the deal to work said one analyst analysts said such a merger would be costly and complicated twa has the best cost structure since icahn succeeded in winning concessions from its unions in order for the other carriers to come down to twa s wage scale in a merger twa would have to be the surviving entity analysts said such a move does not necessarily free icahn of twa they said they said he showed skill in reducing ozark airlines costs when he merged it into twa last year and he might be a necessary ingredient for a merger to work however other analysts speculated the managements of piedmont and usair would not tolerate icahn as head of a new company they said a usair  uisition of twa might be a way for him to exit the company if usair s airline is then merged into twa reuter   talking point purolator courier corp pcc purolator courier corp s stock rose on specualtion that a disgruntled former purolator director would find a new suitor for the company  rs said purolator agreed in late february to a dlr a share mln dlr offer from e f hutton lbo inc and certain members of its purolator courier division s management the stock today hit up one today purolator revealed in a filing with the securities and exchange commission that director doresy gardner resigned from its board of directors in a letter dated march the letter from gardner said he resigned the board because the merger agreement with hutton barred directors from soliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get a better deal gardner said he believes a better offer might be found if the company would agree to be sold to some other entity or if it could sell off all or part of its u s courier division basically the courier division is a company that has mln dlrs in revenues it s a very large company and it s being sold for or mln dlrs said gardner in a telephone interview with reuters gardner is an official of kelso management a firm associated with fidelity international ltd a group of fidelity companies owns eight pct of purolator and gardner said he personally owns shares a purolator official said the company has no comment on the letter from gardner arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service may emerge as a likely bidder for purolator before the transaction with hutton lbo was announced analysts had also speculated another courier company would be the most likely suitor while one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no new bidders he said the possibility one could appear pushed the stock into play again there s no shortage of possibilities it s just a question of management s willingness to let the process continue said one arbitrager arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they believe hutton lbo has taken on no risk in the transaction hutton has begun a tender for pct of purolator at dlrs cash per share the balance of purolator s stock will be bought for securities and warrants in a new company holding the u s courier operations the arbitragers said tender offer documents show that hutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and will emerge with a giant majority equity in purolator as far as i can tell from the public documents from the deal that s on the table hutton is basically putting up zero one always likes a situation like that you always like to think if they can do this deal at no risk there should be someone else in the world that could do it higher said one arbitrager the firm however is supplying temporary financing and sources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the firm will not end up paying for its equity position while one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document did note that the e f hutton group subsidiary may not have to keep cash in the transaction the sources said there is some risk to the firm there are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash and all sorts of things that make it very speculative said one of the sources adding there are also severance payments to employees the e f hutton group subsidiary is supplying mln dlrs in so called bridge financing for the transaction the bridge financing is a temporary loan from hutton the financing is to be replaced with permanent financing expected to come from banks however it may take some time to replace the financing the source said resulting in what could be a substantial expense to the firm gardner said hutton stands to gain fees of to mln dlrs from the transaction but sources close to the transaction said fees are at the low end of the scale it s a very complex transaction but basically what happens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recapture any investment they might have once the merger takes place gardner said reuter   talking point purolator courier pcc emery air freight corp topped a leveraged buyout offer for purolator courier corp by about mln dlrs but wall street is reacting as though another offer may surface purolator s stock climbed today to over emery s dlr per share offer emery topped a dlr per share or mln dlr offer from e f hutton lbo inc some analysts said the latest mln dlr offer for purolator exceeded their expectations several analysts previously had said they saw takeover values for the package delivery company in the dlr per share range at least one however estimated the company could be taken over in a range of to dlrs per share analysts today would not venture to say whether another offer could be made but some arbitragers still held to the belief that the bidding could go higher they have no choice to seek out the best possible offer emery has shown the courage to go forth said one arbitrager who speculated other courier companies may also emerge as bidders it makes sense said james parker of robinson humphrey but it won t make out as well as they think they won t get a pct of the synergies analysts said the  uisition could cost emery  ings in the short term but long term after eliminating redundancies and selling other purolator assets it should boost emery s profitability parker said a combined purolator and emery would rival united parcel service as the second largest u s package delivery company after federal express corp fdx which has pct of the market parker speculated that the combined emery purolator would have about pct of the six to seven billion dlr delivery business this will make emery a bigger factor in the light weight delivery business but it will not make them a power house said douglas arthur of kidder peabody and co purolator today declined comment on the emery offer and its chairman nicholas brady did not return a phone call e f hutton lbo also declined comment on the emery offer but said it extended the expiration and withdrawal period on its offer to april six at midnight from today at midnight est one analyst speculated the extension makes it more likely hutton will attempt another offer however he was skeptical a company outside the package delivery industry would want to outbid dlrs per share because it would not have the same synergies as a courier company since purolator agreed in late february to a buyout by some of its management and the e f hutton group efh subsidiary speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come the buyout was surrounded by controversy since a purolator board member doresy gardner resigned in march gardner said he believed a better offer could be made by another entity a spokesman for gardner today said the former director had no contact with emery nor did he have any other buyers lined up for purolator purolator s deal with hutton was also called into question by a shareholder suit filed earlier this week which attempted to stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth hearings in a new york state court were delayed until monday arbitragers had said they believed the hutton offer could be bettered because the wall street firm was not planning to keep its cash tied up in purolator hutton is providing a mln dlr bridge loan that would later be replaced with other debt hutton would maintain a majority in purolator hutton sources have said the firm was in fact facing risk n its investment since it did not know when it could reclaim its mln dlr loan emery last year lost mln dlrs on revenues of mln dlrs purolator lost mln dlrs on mln dlrs in revenues reuter   talking point santa fe southern sfx santa fe southern pacific corp may have more difficulty combining its two railroads than fending off a possible takeover by henley group heng which has accumulated almost a five pct stake in the real estate and railroad conglomerate analysts said takeover speculation has surrounded santa fe since henley disclosed its stake in the company earlier this week but analysts and a santa fe official were skeptical a takeover is its intention analysts also said the company has strong defenses that would easily deter any suitor one of those being its problems combining its two railroad properties which hang in regulatory limbo richard fischer of merrill lynch and co inc said that santa fe at december had mln dlrs in cash and cash equivalents while its long term debt to capital was just over pct this gives them plenty of borrowing power he said which could be used against an unwanted suitor henley group s chairman michael dingman has said he wants to take major positions in undervalued natural resource companies he also told reuters in an interview he is seeking an  uisition of from two billion to eight billion dlrs santa fe officials don t appear concerned that henley might launch a takeover i would not characterize the atmosphere around here as one of concern one santa fe executive said about henley i think it s wrong to assume dingman has formed a firm strategy with santa fe said mark hassenberg who covers henley for dlj securities analysts say the potential of santa fe s land assets are likely to be realized slowly they add that santa fe s efforts to merge its two railroads remain in regulatory limbo sidetracking many of its strategic plans for the foreseeable future these realities they said support the henley group s statement that its santa fe stake is only an investment the more pressing problem facing santa fe is overcoming difficulties in merging its two railroads the atchison topeka and santa fe railway co and southern pacific transportation co the merger would create the nation s second longest railroad last july the interstate commerce commission icc denied the merger on anticompetitive grounds the company since has granted trackage sharing rights to four western railroads to meet the icc s concerns and persuade it to reopen the hearings in its three year old struggle to merge the lines my guess is the commission will decide in three to six weeks whether to reopen hearings fischer said i believe they ve made an effort to satisfy the icc s objections he said but in doing so they haven t pleased everyone before they had burlington northern on their side now burlington is opposed to the way trackage rights are set up if the hearings are reopened analysts predicted it will take six to nine months for everyone to have their say and up to another year for the icc to decide santa fe is in the midst of a mln share stock buyback program begun in it has bought back mln shares as of february when it had mln shares outstanding a spokesman said among the shares repurchased were two stakes owned by norfolk southern one of mln shares bought in and another of mln shares in one analyst said james voytko at paine webber believes santa fe could fight off the henley group with its cash and credit citing the share buybacks from norfolk southern he said one of santa fe s options if threatened could be to buy the henley stake it is indeed possible that dingman sees this as a low risk opportunistic investment voytko said people who follow santa fe have given me values of dlrs to dlrs a share said dlj securities hassenberg but i m certain that in dingman s mind the company is worth more than that in breakup value reuter   talking point viacom international

operator both sides raised their bids over the weekend a source close to the management side insisted that timing was on his side he said if outside directors approve the management proposal a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders with proxy material going out late this week it would take days from the day we mail said the source the source predicted national amusements controlled by

newest proposal offers holders dlrs in cash a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a value of dlrs and one fifth of a share of common stock stock of arsenal holdings representing

exchangeable preferred stock worth dlrs and a fractional share of convertible preferred the arbitrageur said the equity portion was worth about dlrs for a total of dlrs redstone s newest plan raised the amount of he would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond april that a merger with arsenal is not consummated the plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct during may and pct thereafter previously redstone offered eight pct other arbitrageurs said both redstone and the management group led by president and chief executive terrence elkes were offering
