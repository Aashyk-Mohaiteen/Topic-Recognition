rose five pct to billion marks against the same period for the year as a whole incoming orders should rise between one and two billion marks to around or billion apart from payments for the nuclear

turnover in the first five months rose particularly strongly in the installations and automotive technology communications and telecommunications sectors but components and energy and automation

on revenue of the sharp drop in the dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuel prices there was no such offset for the strength of the franc against other european currencies income and

reuter   talking point general motors gm general motors corp staged an explosive rally on wall street after a share buyback program announced yesterday but analysts said gm s future remains clouded by stiff competition and erosion of market share gm shares rose to in active trading analysts agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they differed sharply over the carmaker s long term prospects i m very positive on gm said jack kirnan of kidder peabody and co they re clearly committed to enhancing shareholder value however some analysts worry about how gm will pay for the buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to recapture lost market share after the market had closed yesterday gm said it would buy back pct of its common stock by the end of the announcement sent investors today scrambling for gm shares with more than mln shares changing hands by mid day the buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning and at least one increased his  ings estimates for gm based on a good performance expected from new car models but david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc said the repurchase program is not a positive the buyback doesn t really change the  ings outlook and puts more stress on the balance sheet he said since gm will have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases the stock should settle back down to around he added healy projects gm will five dlrs a share in and dlrs in compared to  ings of dlrs healy s numbers are near the low end of wall street estimates which range from five dlrs to dlrs in and from four dlrs to dlrs in like other analysts healy sees gm s share of the domestic car and truck market falling in on balance gm cars are not selling as well as their competitors he said in late february gm car sales fell pct from the year ago period while competitors ford motor co f and chrysler corp c both posted increases but gm said february sales showed improvement over january adding that it expects improvement in coming months overall gm s share of u s car and truck sales should fall to around or pct in from pct at the end of analysts said the numbers include imports kidder peabody s kirnan said cost reductions and product improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the fourth quarter which will help gm finance the buyback gm stock has been a real laggard and now it s rolling up its sleeves and getting serious i think there s a major  ings surprise in the winds he said kirnan raised his  ings estimates slightly today in part in reaction to the announced buyback and sees gm  ing dlrs this year and dlrs in the company is more concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation with respect to ford and chrysler he said another positive for the stock is gm s dividend currently five dlrs a share annually which gives it a higher yield than its competitors kirnan said and gm will raise the cash dividend to cts a share next year he predicted but analyst michael lucky of shearson lehman brothers inc said u s car sales will weaken and gm s new products if successful will only slow but not halt the erosion of its market share i believe their new cars will be successful but that will only curtail losses in market share which will fall to around pct by lucky said philip fricke of goldman sachs and co falls in the middle of the bulls and bears while he is recommending gm stock he said results will not improve until i m not looking for improvement this year this is a transition year for gm he said fricke who estimates  ings at dlrs and at dlrs said cost cutting and new car models will not affect results but the key thing isn t so much what they this year it s the momentum beyond this year that s important

bancorporation fbt which is actively seeking a merger or other form of new capital lost mln dlrs love said texas commerce had turned the corner on its energy loan portfolio problems but added that the bank s nonperforming real estate loans may increase during i think the tidal wave in energy has passed over us he said the fact that the real estate market is still moving away suggests there could be some continuing growth of nonperforming loans in about pct of texas commerce s net loan losses related to real estate lending and pct was due to energy loan losses that compares to when only pct of the bank s losses were in real estate and energy accounted for pct more than half of texas commerce s nonperforming loans which totaled mln dlrs at yearend up from mln dlrs the year before were in real estate love said he believed the real estate loan problems for texas commerce and other major state banks would peak by the third or fourth quarter of absorption of empty office buildings in houston which has a current vacancy rate of about pct will be a gradual process that could take up to four years he said i think we may be beginning to stabilize this economy oil at dlrs a barrel brings much more confidence than dlrs a barrel he said texas commerce will retain its name as a separate subsidiary of chemical and plans to aggressively expand its holdings throughout texas offering additional products to build up its consumer banking business love said we are resuming what we did best for years an offensive position he said in january texas commerce  uired a failed bank in montgomery county adjacent to the houston metropolitan area and earlier this month opened a new bank in san antonio texas commerce plans to add more banks in san antonio and in the dallas fort worth

reuter   u s bank income shows first drop in years problems in the farmbelt and oilpatch regions contributed to the first decline in overall income for u s banks in a quarter century the federal deposit insurance corp fdic said the nation s commercial banks had net income of billion dlrs in down slightly from s record billion dlrs the total was still the second highest ever reported but it was the first time income had not grown since the figures reflected a radical split in the health of banks in the two halves of the country the fdic said in the east one in banks had losses last year while one in four banks west of the mississippi river had losses nationwide one out of five banks reported losses the fdic said in the first of a new series of quarterly banking profiles it planned to issue i don t remember a time when there was such a clear distinction by geographic area fdic chairman william seidman told reporters he said that while the figures were not good they showed the problem did not lie with the banking system as a whole but with regional differences in economic performance some banks have failed so far this year twice as many as failed by this time a year ago but seidman said he doubted the pace would continue on a positive note banks increased capital to a record billion dlrs last year and there has been a slowing in the number of new problem banks in all regions except the southwest seidman said banks provision for losses from bad loans in the fourth quarter increased to billion dlrs a pct rise from a year ago large banks those with assets of one billion dlrs or more reporting fourth quarter losses totaled the fdic said seidman said it was too early to say what effect brazil s moratorium on debt payments would have on u s banks he said bank deregulation had given managers more freedom to run their banks and that an increase in failures was to be expected but this freedom from regulatory restraints also has meant other banks that were better managed have gotten stronger seidman said reuter   u s company  ings highlights first quarter anchor financial corp shr cts vs nine months biomet inc shr cts vs federal co shr dlrs vs

company s liquid natural gas and mln for the early months of its owner  of gulf canada s marketing assets ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of a further reorganisation programme which was partly offset by a withdrawal of surplus funds from u s pension schemes and a mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling its u s flag  ping operation the immediate outlook for oil prices was uncertain although it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increase in the near term however ultramar said it was optimistic prices would strengthen over the longer term its substantial
