uisition of gelco corp s gec canadian unit has dramatically altered canada s fast growing courier industry largely dominated by u s companies until this year company officials and analysts said state

purolator courier ltd from new jersey based purolator courier corp pcc but analysts said the two  uisitions were prompted by financial restructuring undertaken by the u s parent companies and likely don t represent an industry trend toward buying out foreign owned courier operations it s a case of whether you can buy from the right people at the right time mcleod young weir ltd transportation analyst tony hine commented the two  uisitions fit with a larger move by u s companies embroiled in a take over or restructuring to sell off their canadian units to generate ready cash said nesbitt thomson deacon inc analyst harold wolkin there is a very good correlation between the u s parent selling canadian subsidiaries and the u s parent either being under siege or taking someone else over

uisitions totalled about mln canadian dlrs and the two business have combined yearly revenues of mln dlrs she said the  uisition fit with air canada s strategy of seeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline business gelco will continue to operate with current management independently of air canada although air canada already operates its own air cargo business that includes a small door to door courier operation they re well run they re a good investment they re doing well in a growing market and that s the way we want to keep it szynkarsky said analyst hine said the gelco and purolator canadian units will likely retain operating links with their u s delivery network generating traffic for the former parent companies without them having to tie up capital in canada the nature of the business is that incremental traffic is incremental revenue hine said it s sort of a sausage maker business where you put in place the sausage grinder and the more sausage you can stuff

vacant it also created four new positions for chairmen of its operating divisions analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most sense contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total spinoff some analysts however disagreed that any spinoff of shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for american express contributing about pct of  ings last year i think it is highly unlikely that american express is going to sell shearson said perrin long of lipper analytical he questioned what would be a better investment than a very profitable securities firm several analysts said american express is not in need of cash which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong asset but others believe the company could very well of considered the option of spinning out part of shearson and one rumor suggests selling about pct of it in the market larry eckenfelder of prudential bache securities said he believes american express could have considered a partial spinoff in the past shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a big premium in the market place shearson s book value is in the mln dlr range shearson in the market place would probably be worth three to bilion dlrs in terms of market capitalization said eckenfelder some analysts said american express could use capital since it plans to expand globally they have enormous internal growth plans that takes capital you want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the road said e f hutton group analyst michael lewis they ve outlined the fact that they re investing heavily in the future which goes heavily into the international arena said lewis that does not preclude  uisitions and divestitures along the way he said lewis said if american express reduced its exposure to the brokerage business by selling part of shearson its stock might better reflect other assets such as the travel related services business it could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure to brokerage the value of the other components could command a higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of the

because it is concerned that its stock price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm shearson contributed mln dlrs of american express billion dlr net in american express ambitious plans for international growth may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part of shearson would bring analysts speculated that all of shearson would have a market value of about billion dlrs to some however the need for added capital is puzzling american express is in a position where they can raise capital if they need to said larry eckenfelder of prudential bache securities analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of shearson management wednesday chief operating officer jeffrey lane got the added previously vacant post of president the reorganization also created four new positions for chairmen of shearson s operating divisions a move analysts speculated would allow shearson to be a stand alone company analysts contacted on sunday said the statement does little to clarify last week s market speculation it does confirm however that the financial services firm which unsuccessfully attempted to expand shearson with a major  uisition last year is
