that date without giving days notice to usair twa also agreed that it would not knowingly and willingly interfere with the consummation of the merger between usair and piedmont aviation inc pie twa

additional common stock as a result of the agreement the court removed a previous temporary restraining order against twa the company said twa and usair have also agreed that all litigation between

deposit of the stock in a voting trust pending dot approval twa said that in respect to usair s recent offer for piedmont aviation pie it believes that usair s shareholders would prefer a cash merger proposal for usair over its proposed  uisition of piedmont twa said however it also would be  ed in discussing a three way deal among usair piedmont and twa twa said the merger is subject to the usair board redeeming the preferred stock purchase rights the poison pill issued to shareholders last year and taking action so that the vote of a majority of the outstanding common stock is required to

said it still believes a combination of the two airlines would have benefits to both in a filing with the securities and exchange commission twa which is controlled by carl icahn said it continues to closely watch the developments of usair which has an agreement to  uire piedmont aviation inc pie twa said it spent mln dlrs to  uire its usair shares which amount to pct of its total outstanding common stock twa said it would not buy more usair group stock at least for the moment but it said it still believes a twa usair combination would create certain synergies that would be mutually beneficial to both carriers twa stressed that it reserved the right to revive its takeover attempt and said it may continue to explore the feasibility and strategies of gaining control of usair further purchases of usair stock would require the approval of the department of transportation twa said because of department of transportation rules twa also said it put its usair stock into a

usair which at the time was negotiating its proposed merger with piedmont aviation inc on march twa withdrew its bid saying it did not intend to seek control of usair group or to  uire more of its stock at the time twa also said in the filing with the securities and exchange commission that its chairman carl icahn is the target of an sec probe of alleged violations of securities laws in its filings with the sec twa said it paid mln dlrs for its usair stock with this out of the way if it indeed was bought by institutions it paves the way for better value for usair stock later said janney

off on volume of mln shares twa stock rose one to reuter   twa twa sues usair u over poison pill trans world airlines inc said it filed suit in delaware chancery court against usair group inc and its board of directors seeking to invalidate its poison pill anti takeover plan twa vice president and general counsel mark buckstein said twa also sought a declaratory judgement from the court that its dlr per share takeover offer for usair would in no way interfer with usair s possible buyout of peidmont aviation inc pie buckstein said twa asked the court to enjoin the enforcement of usair s shareholder rights plan or poison pill such provisions which typically allow for the issue of securities to shareholders in the event of a hostile takeover bid are aimed at deterring takeovers by making them more expensive usair earlier today rejected twa s offer saying twa s bid was an attempt to interfer with its buyout of piedmont usair also had said its counsel would investigate the matter tonight a spokesman for usair said the airline had no comment on twa s lawsuit usair did respond however to a twa request to the department of transportation for permission to buy up to pct of usair stock and place the stock in a voting trust pending approval of a takeover usair said the request was hastily pasted together in order to take advantage of a regulatory anamoly that would allow twa to accomplish in a regulated environment actions that would be impermissable in the non regulated economy at large usair called on the transportation department to reject twa s request reuter   twa twa tangles piedmont pie situation trans world airlines inc complicated the bidding for piedmont aviation inc by offering either to buy piedmont suitor usair group or alternatively to merge with piedmont and usair piedmont s board was meeting today and wall street speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from norfolk southern corp and usair the twa offer was announced shortly after the piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin twa offered to buy usair for dlrs cash per share it also said it was the largest shareholder of usair and threatened to go directly to usair shareholders with an offer for pct of the stock at a lower price twa also said it believed its offer was a better deal for usair shareholders than an  uisition of piedmont but it said it alternatively would discuss a three way combination of the airlines market sources and analysts speculated that twa chairman carl icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into the takeover arena we re just wondering if he s not just trying to get twa into play there s speculation on the street he just wants to move onto somthing else said one arbitrager we think twa might just be putting up a trial balloon analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by usair but that the airline will probably reject it because the price is relatively low compared to other airline deals they also said icahn must prove his offer credible by revealing financing arrangements they need to show their commitment and their ability to finance i think it s a credible offer said timothy pettee a bear st s analyst i think it s certainly on the low end of relative values of airline deals said pettee pettee estimated dlrs would be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers usair stock soared after twa made public its offer a spokesman for usair declined comment and said usair had not changed its offer for piedmont usair offered of buy pct of that airline s stock for dlrs cash per share and the balance for dlrs per share in usair stock usair closed up at on volume of mln shares piedmont which slipped to close at also remained silent on the twa action piedmont has an outstanding dlr cash per share offer from norfolk southern corp norfolk southern declined comment but said it stuck with its offer for piedmont norfolk owns about pct of piedmont and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover of piedmont some analysts said icahn may be trying to  uire usair to make his own airline a more attractive takeover target icahn i think had wanted to sell his airline and there were no takers i think the strategy might have called for making his investment more attractive one way to accomplish that specific objective is to go out and  uire other airlines said andrew kim of eberstadt fleming i don t know whose going to buy them but at least this way it becomes a much more viable package said kim but icahn s financing ability for such a transaction remains in doubt in part because of twa s heavy debt load wall street sources said twa has some cash with which to do the offer the sources said icahn has not lined up outside financial advisers and plans to make his own arrangements icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy usx corp x and still retains pct of that company s stock some wall street sources said the financier s usx plan was impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser drexel burnham lambert inc because of wall street s insider trading scandal industry sources also predicted usair might reject the twa offer on price and financing concerns it s littered with contingencies and it doesn t even have a financing arrangement said one executive at another major airline but the executive conceded a merged twa usair would be a strong contender with usair s east coast route system and planned west coast presence from psa usair could feed the intenrational flights of twa which has a midwest presence in its st louis hub adding piedmont dominant in the southeast to the mix would develop an even stronger force the combined entity would also have twa s pars reservation system such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would
