benefit from its gatt participation he said the problems facing u s china and gatt member  are similar a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual

reagan expected to focus on superpower arms control moves and issues french officials said a major aim of chirac s visit was to present france s concern that the united states might ignore european security  s in any accord with moscow on removing medium range nuclear missiles from the continent but reagan was expected to assure chirac that he will not agree to a deal at the geneva superpower talks that would give the russians superiority in shorter range systems diplomats said france has expressed doubts about removing u s missiles from europe so long as the soviet union maintains an edge in other weaponry particularly shorter range rockets conventional forces and chemical weapons speaking last night chirac set out the french position saying any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces should mention how equality can be achieved in short range missiles reagan and chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending a dispute between two leading research institutes over patent rights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease aids in a joint statement chirac and reagan said the pasteur institute in paris and the national cancer institute of bethesda maryland agreed to give part of the royalties from the test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fight against aids  uired immune deficiency syndrome this agreement opens a new era in franco american cooperation allowing france and the united states to join their efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes of speeding the development of an aids vaccine and cure reagan said at the signing ceremony he said the two parties would share the patent and give per cent of the royalties received to the new foundation the foundation would also raise private funds and would donate per cent of its money to combat aids in less developed countries both leaders stressed the long ties between france and the united states during a welcoming ceremony in the white house east room with reagan describing france as america s

expressed concern that protectionism at the heart of a new showdown between the united states and japan might spread throughout the industrial world but in an interview with reuters conable said the action by the united states to slap tariffs on certain electronic goods from japan did not mean the countries were heading for a full scale war conable said the world bank has been pressing developing countries to open their markets arguing that a free trading environment increased the possibility of global economic growth we have in fact been making adjustment loans to many countries in the developing world which have encouraged the opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the developed world doesn t close at the same time he said he said the u s action against japan was a significant retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in policy the interview came just before next week s semi annual meetings of the bank and the international monetary fund referring to brazil s recent payments moratorium conable also said the global debt situation was very serious and must be closely watched he said the bank which in the past has concentrated on making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the developing world such as dams roads and sewers will increasingly make assistance available for economic reform the bank has increased these loans in part because of the debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms aimed at opening their markets encouraging foreign investment and reducing government s role in the economy we re comfortable with adjustment lending we expect however that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio conable said he made clear however that adjustment lending would continue to increase as a proportion of overall bank lending for some time he noted the problem of debt was a severe one and many countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the problem of debt conable is a a former republican congressman from new york chosen by president reagan for the bank position last year he is an associate of treasury secertary james baker who launched the u s strategy for shoring up indebted nations in october which included a call for increased adjustment lending by the world bank conable also said that he expected the result of a major study of the bank s organization to be completed in the next several weeks he said the decision to seek a reorganization was based in part on the fact that the bank had come under fire from the poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the richest countries because of inefficiency the reorganization is considered a major initiative by conable and is being closely watched by the agency s member countries as an indication of his management style and priorities i want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be permitted to grow conable said however he said i don t believe there is anything basically wrong with this institution and i don t believe it has to have any redefinition of its purpose he said however that it was apparent that the debt initiative proposed by baker has given the bank a central role in dealing with the debt crisis conable added that cooperation between the bank and its sister agency the international monetary fund was good and that he talked often with imf managing director michel camdessus on a variety of issues on a personal level conable said that he not feel a need to put his personal stamp on the bank noting that i don t have a particular mission here except to be useful to the institution and to the process of development he added so i don t feel a great calling to personalize the institution on the development needs of sub sahara africa conable said that the bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting the region noting that half of the recently agreed financing of billion dlrs for bank s international development association was earmarked for africa leading industrial nations are expected to consider new forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations like those in the sub sahara during next week s meetings reuter   consensus builds for world agricultural reform top u s and european farm and government representatives called for a sweeping reform of world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply imbalance speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here demonstrated a growing u s european consensus on the need for an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm and production it is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and harmony into the world agricultural if not the disruptions in markets may grow even more severe the walls of protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation become more harmful u s department of agriculture deputy administrator william bailey said bailey said his attendance at the two day meeting which ends tomorrow demonstrated the u s recognises the need to adjust its policies to the changing market environment the need for urgent reforms is justified by the imbalance and tensions of the world economy the secretary general of the organisation for economic cooperation and development jean claude paye said and the forum for such a reform is the general agreement on tariffs and he noted paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures to help farmers in unprofitable areas another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm prices allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand and instead help farmers through income support and adjustment aids proposed james howard executive vice president of cargill usa one of the world s largest cereal houses franz josef feiter agricultural adviser to west german chancellor helmut kohl agreed the european community must take greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices however differentiated policy treatment is required to take account of large disparities in the situation around the ec he said agriculture is an efficient sector of the european economy and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the community he

before they get better director general of the dutch economics ministry s foreign affairs division frans engering said speaking at an american chamber of commerce lunch in the hague engering noted the developing history of crises over steel citrus and pasta and warned of more to come i consider the strident tone of us declarations on airbus ill advised and the ec fats and oils tax proposal a dangerous provocation he said i feel that we shall probably have to deal with quite a few more crises in the foreseeable future not only is the us congress clearly very determined to get the american balance of payments into better shape but the risks of brinkman  are all the greater because the ec has its own constraints in meeting outside pressure engering noted if we ask ourselves whether it is perhaps inevitable that we keep pushing each other to the brink of actual war then i think the answer is probably yes he said in order to reduce these tensions decision making in the ec must become less self centred and the us administration will have to exercise the authority to convince congress and pressure groups of the need for accommodation he added reuter   dutch fully in balance but down

recognise west berlin as part of the nation ec under the treaty of rome all contracts and agreements signed by the community must contain this territorial clause stipulating west berlin is an integral part of the ec an ec negotiator taking part in the three day talks said we wanted the territorial clause in but comecon said no a joint statement issued after the talks said progress was made towards clarifying positions but another meeting would be necessary to complete the work any decision in principle to set up relations would require approval by the community s council of ministers and by the executive committee of comecon zdzislaw kuroski deputy director of comecon who heads the east bloc delegation told reuters ahead of today s session we have narrowed our differences on a range of questions but not on all questions asked whether comecon would accept ec insistence that any joint declaration stipulate west berlin as part of the community he replied this question is not contained in the draft which our side presented west german diplomats said they would insist on including the clause on west berlin in any ec comecon agreement the talks followed an earlier round between the

links agricultural talks to other reform the european community ec considers talks on agricultural reform to be inseperable from talks on other reform in the present gatt round willy de clercq external relations commissioner of the ec said he told reporters here the ec would not bow to pressure to reach an early seperate agreement on agricultural he said the ec wanted to stick to the four year schedule agreed by members of the general agreement on tariffs and gatt in punta del este uruguay last year that included agricultural liberalisation for the first time in the lengthy program to re negotiate the gatt other issues being discussed in the current gatt round include reform of in merchandise and services de clercq is on his way to china after attending a two day conference for gatt ministers held in new zealand several of those ministers criticised the ec for what they saw as restrictive agricultural practices and called for urgent reforms u s representative clayton yeutter also said it was important agreement on agricultural reform was reached as early as possible but de clercq said the gatt program had been reached after long and hard negotiations and the ec did not want changes we just want to stick to the agreement which was reached and that was very clear that the new round would be one undertaking it is a global negotiation with no two tracks no fast track no slow track it has just one track the track and that s all de clercq said if you start selecting priorities your priority is not my priority we say that agriculture is urgent but it s not the only

head of the ec delegation in washington said pending u s legislation is a misguided attempt to deal with the nation s deficit and will spark retaliation if passed in its present form to think that you can deal with a deficit by legislation is a mistake he told the foreign association here denman told reporters that possible retaliation which he warned of in a letter to house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski would not necessarily be on a product for product basis retaliation does not have to be matched product to product denman said he said in the case of textiles import restrictions however retaliation would be against u s textile exports certainly if restrictions were imposed on european exports of textiles to the u s the community would be likely to retaliate with restrictions on u s textile exports to europe denman said he also took exception to u s proposals to require countries with large current account surpluses with the u s to cut those surpluses or face special tariffs this would conflict with international obligations throw a large wrench into the current round of negotiations and could easily boomerang he warned of the tariff proposals denman also took exception to u s efforts to seek reciprocity in specific sectors forcing reciprocity in one sector by imposing barriers would simply lead to retaliation from the other party he said adding that overall reciprocity can only be achieved by trading off disadvantages in one sector for advantages in another reuter   ec says u s broke rules in akzo dupont row the european community commission has charged the united states with breaking international rules by excluding dutch made fibres from the u s market and said it would take the issue to the world body gatt in the latest of a series of disputes with washington the executive authority alleged that a section of the u s tariff act was incompatible with the gatt general agreement on tariffs and because it discriminated against imported products in favour of domestically produced goods the commission said it would ask geneva based gatt to rule on whether the section in question which officials said had proved a barrier to many ec exporters conformed to its rules commission officials did not rule out retaliatory measures if after a gatt decision against it washington failed to bring the disputed section into line with international rules the executive s decision to go to gatt follows a complaint to it by the dutch company akzo akzo as whose aramid synthetic fibres have been banned from the u s market because of charges by the u s firm dupont that the fibres violate the american company s patents akzo alleged that the ban imposed by the u s international commission itc was discriminatory and incompatible with gatt provisions the dispute centres on the fact that section of the u s tariff act gives the itc jurisdiction over imported products the ec commission charged that ec producers did not have the same possibilities for defending themselves before the itc as they would have in a normal u s court consequently the procedure followed is less favourable than that which takes places in normal courts of law for goods produced in the united states it said in a statement reuter   ec warns congress on new bill the european community ec has warned the u s house of representatives that tough legislation it is considering could prompt retaliation by u s trading partners the warning was sent in a letter from sir roy denman head of the ec delegation in washington to dan rostenkowski chairman of the house ways and means committee a copy of the letter was made available to reuters denman told rostenkowski an illinois democrat he backed aspects of the bill such as one backing new talks under the gatt and one excluding protection for the textile industry but denman disagreed with other provisions which would require president reagan to take retaliatory action against nations with large surpluses with the u s and would set new standards for judging unfair foreign practices denman told rostenkowski that gatt regulations prohibit member nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action in disputes unless the action is gatt approved he said if the congress makes retaliatory action mandatory then the united states would be in violation of its international legal obligations and on a collision course with its major trading partners denman added that a president should have flexibility in enforcing laws saying in the last resort any administration must take its decision in light of the overall national otherwise he said the risk would be counter reaction by trading partners of the united states i e retaliation or enactment of mirror image legislation to be employed against imports from the united states denman also said congress could prompt retaliation if it reduced the threshhold of unfair by making it easier for firms to file unfair practice claims retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standards for findings that imports were injuring u s firms changes in these standards must be agreed upon multilaterally they cannot be imposed by the united states alone on the world trading system he said house leaders have rejected a plan by textile state legislators to add to the bill a provision to curb imports of cloth and clothing similar to a measure passed two years ago but vetoed by president reagan there was concern by the leaders that reagan would veto the entire bill because of the textile amendment reuter   ec warns u s and japan

a u s japan pact on semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening japan s market to foreign chips industry analysts said but doubts remain over whether the ministry of international and industry miti which is pressuring the firms can successfully battle market forces and whether the u s industry is geared up to take advantage of any breathing space they said u s threats to scrap the agreement signed last september have pushed miti to try harder to get recalcitrant japanese chipmakers to abide by the pact the analysts said miti has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry to get things done said bache securities japan associate vice president peter wolffe last month miti told chipmakers to cut production for the january to march period by pct to help dry up inexpensive chips that have escaped from japan to grey markets not subject to the pact s price controls the ministry also asked electronics firms to provide distributors with certificates designating them as authorised exporters in an effort to close loopholes through which grey marketeers sneak chips out of japan market analysts said u s negotiators here last week said the pact was in jeopardy because of continued dumping in non american markets and little sign of increased foreign sales in japan but major japanese firms appear to have agreed to the production cuts several analysts said last week nec corp said it would cut production in line with miti s request nec has been the most aggressive in resisting miti s demands said david keller analyst at james capel and co once nec cuts production it means they all have still pressures remain to keep production high japanese firms need high output to cut unit prices for u s sales that the commerce department assigns them under the pact the best way to lower cost is to produce more said salomon brothers asia ltd analyst carole ryavec preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also spur higher production next quarter merrill lynch analyst matt aizawa said grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new restrictions some industry officials said it s like tax avoidance schemes said steve donovan head of mmi japan k k as soon as you close one route another opens miti s pressure has annoyed some makers who had earlier shrugged off miti guidance it s getting to be like communism said one but analysts said output cuts could help by making it easier to increase prices as planned on april and forcing firms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss they re going to have to start running their businesses like businesses bache s wolffe said miti has also been conducting a highly public campaign urging chip users to buy foreign made chips but u s industry officials said response has been mixed at best there has been some change but it s not across the board said one u s spokesman the companies have a varying degree of urgency the ultimate impact of all these efforts by miti on the troubled u s industry remains in doubt analysts added pressure to cut production of kilobit dram dynamic random access memory chips could merely speed the transition to one megabit chips where japan now leads analysts said whether u s firms are able to stage a comeback in memory chips or  ed in doing so also remains unclear they said analysts are watching with the fate of a new u s consortium which hopes to challenge japan by developing the most advanced technology for microchip manufacturing even in the thorny area of access much depends on u s commitment as well as on japanese openness some said the sia u s semiconductor industry association doesn t even have an office here a source close to the industry said you could question just how committed they are in addition some industry analysts question the

lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses some of them are too sophisticated to convert into financial terms one banking source said but western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate they say it is blurred by the poor performance of poland s economy and dismiss the billion dlr figure as illusory sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under achieving they did have a bad effect yes but they only contributed to largely internal economic problems one said the u s imposed the measures and withdrew most favoured nation mfn trading status from poland in in retaliation for suppression of the solidarity free union under martial law the estimated cost to the polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the institute of national economy an offshoot of the central planning commission according to one western envoy an expert on polish economic affairs it extrapolated information on growth trends in with the united states as well as increases in credits from western commercial and government lenders but the calculations were based on a time when was booming and credits still flowed freely he said dismissing the estimate as a theoretical projection based on a high point which has no real scientific evaluation a foreign ministry official said polish exports to the u s in the late s averaged around mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed imports have suffered slumping from around mln dlrs to mln as credits ran out poland has a dwindling surplus with the west last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted billion official figures show acknowledging that sanctions have lost poland important u s markets including agricultural equipment textiles chemicals and some foodstuffs western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons poland is accusing the west of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons said one expert it s an illusion based on a misunderstanding of western economy there s a
