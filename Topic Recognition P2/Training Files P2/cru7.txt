defence contract to supply fighter aircraft worth five billion stg reuter   saudi february output put at mln bpd saudi oil output last month fell to an average of mln barrels per day bpd from mln bpd in january gulf oil sources said they said exports from the ras tanurah and ju aymah terminals in the gulf fell to an average mln bpd last month from mln in january because of lower liftings by some customers but the drop was much smaller than expected after gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of february to mln bpd from mln in the third week the sources said the production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage which are generally considered part of a country s output for opec purposes saudi arabia has an opec quota of mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the nation group last december to back new official oil prices averaging dlrs a barrel the sources said the two fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift february entitlements before the month end last week s high export levels appeared to show continued support for official opec prices from saudi arabia s main customers the four ex partners of aramco the sources said the four exxon corp xon mobil corp mob texaco inc tx and chevron corp chv signed a long term agreement last month to buy saudi for dlrs a barrel however the

fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below opec levels saudi arabian oil minister hisham nazer yesterday reiterated the kingdom s commitment to the december opec accord and said it would never sell below official prices the sources said total saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in february to an average mln bpd from mln in january because of cuts at the yanbu and jubail export

exports from gulf ports averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last sunday down from a february average of mln bpd they said saudi arabia was allowing production to fluctuate with lifting nominations and was not trying to maintain artificially high levels by putting oil into storage the kingdom s main buyers the four u s oil firms with past stakes in the national oil company aramco

wellemeyer speaking to reporters at an offshore oil engineering conference also said he expected opec nations to attempt to hold prices under dlrs a barrel for several years to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong over the next few weeks i think you ll see a concerted effort by the saudis to get production down wellemeyer said the saudis are committed to that price level of dlrs a barrel and are willing to make it happen again he said in recent weeks oil prices fell to the to dlrs a barrel level on market reports of some ope members producing above their quota pushing total opec production to mln barrels per day but prices rebounded today with april u s prices up about one dlr to over dlrs a barrel on a belief saudi arabia is attempting to curb opec output wellemeyer said that sharp declines in u s oil production could push demand for opec oil above mln barrels per day as early as and up to mln barrels per day by although the projected increases in demand for opec oil should strengthen world prices wellemeyer said he believed the organization would hold its official price below dlrs a barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from switching to natural

troubled oil producers his proposal to revitalize texas oil industry would exempt stripper wells that produce barrels of oil or less each day from the state s pct severance tax he said that the majority of texas oil wells fall within the stripper well category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be crucial in determining if the well remains in production nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves secondary and tertiary oil production expensive methods of production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover oil should also be exempted from the severance tax nugent said his plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day for three years or until the price of oil reaches a barrel we ve been sitting back and waiting on two federal administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the nation to follow i say we have waited long enough nugent said in other words let s tell washington to either lead follow or get out of the way nugent said that the

for the commercial judgment of the oil companies she told the arabic language daily al sharq al awsat in an interview coinciding with a visit to london by king fahd of saudi arabia thatcher said this policy had not contributed to the fall in oil prices as north sea production was now about the same as in when prices were close to dlrs a barrel british production was on a plateau and was unlikely to increase in the future she said we naturally share the concern of saudi arabia and other opec members about the harmful effects of oil market volatility for both producer and consumer countries
