behind gulf international bank bsc gib said the bank s economist henry azzam said in a review of gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts he said the gib study reviewed capital markets under three categories money markets stock and bond markets azzam said gulf states had been making greater use of short term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities nevertheless bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lagging behind he said most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues only kuwait has an official stock exchange while other gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges but with dwindling financial surpluses in the gulf governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges azzam said he said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region in addition family firms are reluctant to go public financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth a sharp fall in share prices in the early s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some gulf countries and authorities apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets he called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of gulf cooperation council gcc states bahrain kuwait qatar oman saudi arabia and the united arab emirates uae some moves had been taken in this direction with bahrain allowing gcc nationals to own up to pct of locally incorporated companies azzam said gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in

liberalization of italy s foreign exchange controls should be gradual but also reasonably rapid a report issued by a study committee nominated by the italian treasury ministry said the report looking

she does not expect to consider joining until after the next uk election due by mid at the latest but lawson in answer to a question told reporters after an informal european community finance ministers meeting here that other factors apart from the upcoming election stood in the way of full member  in addition to the question of the exchange rates at which britain should enter the ems s core exchange rate mechanism there was also the impact of sterling member  on the system to be considered he said british entry would change the ems from a monopolar system based on the west german mark to a bipolar mark sterling system he noted we have to make sure it would work but lawson added that some of the considerations that had made it difficult for britain to join in the past now posed less of a problem as an example he cited sterling s role as a petrocurrency which he said was diminishing that argument has clearly weakened he said lawson restated that the government was keeping the

officials said financial markets are convinced for now the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic growth the narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the normally unruly financial markets and next month s talks seem likely to build on that stability a reagan administration official said the paris agreement last month was the main reason markets were calm but he said in an interview that financial markets also understood that all six countries concluded that the measures to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster stability of exchange rates around current levels that is in fact what has happened since paris monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and cease to quarrel over short term policy objectives instead they have focused on medium term policy goals but left room to adjust their agreements with

which refused to join the paris pact was invited back by treasury secretary james baker since paris there are signs west german growth is slowing while u s officials said they were giving japan until april to show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing signs of concern about german prospects emerged recently when bundesbank central bank president karl otto poehl told bankers he would consider cutting west german rates if the fed was ready to follow suit a reagan administration official said this would show there had been some change in approach on the part of the central bank in germany but he declined to comment on the prospects for action by the fed and the bundesbank if there is such a provision it is private and if i talked about it it would no longer be private said the official who asked not to be identified public comments by fed officials suggest the central bank is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged but if the major economies continue to show sluggish
