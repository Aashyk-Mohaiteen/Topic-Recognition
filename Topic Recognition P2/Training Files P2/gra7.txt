government outlays of up to mln dlrs however the use of certificates preclude the need for to mln dlrs in storage and handling costs resulting in net savings for the government of mln dlrs he said without the use of certificates amstutz said nearly the entire crop which had been put under loan would have been forfeited to the commodity credit corporation ccc in addition mln bushels of that have been redeemed from ccc inventory through certificate exchanges would have remained in the goverment inventory he said when asked to comment on a recent study by the general accounting office that concluded certificates result in a net cost to the government amstutz said gao underestimated the benefits and overstated the costs of the certificate program amstutz said while certificates encourage

improved debt situation and decreased carrying costs he said certificates are an integral part of usda s long range market oriented farm policy he said amstutz told subcommittee chairman rep dan
