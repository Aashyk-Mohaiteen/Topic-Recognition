the japanese government appears to have little new to offer to settle a dispute with the u s over computer chips analysts and government officials said the u s has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to mln dlrs on japanese electronics exports to the u s in retaliation for japan s alleged failure to keep a pact on the microchip signed last september a foreign ministry official told reuters japan has done what it can and now we must persuade the united states to wait for those steps to take effect the u s alleges that in defiance of the september agreement japan is still selling microchips at below cost in non u s markets and refusing to open japan further to u s chip sales u s tariffs are due to take effect on april analysts noted japan s ministry of international and industry miti has already ordered chipmakers to cut production in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in third countries at non regulated prices i m not sure miti can do much more than it has said jardine fleming securities ltd analyst nick edwards a miti official said the ministry was not planning to call for production cuts beyond those already sought although it would continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods spokesmen for some japanese electronics firms said they would consider buying more u s chips but a matsushita electric industrial co spokesman said a rapid increase in imports was not likely most analysts said japanese exporters would be hard hit if the united states did implement the tariffs which would be levied on consumer electronics products rather than on microchips themselves if the tariffs remain in place for any length of time there will be complete erosion of exports to the united states said tom murtha analyst at james capel and co the japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be stopped altogether but recovery for the industry will be delayed for another year he said some analysts said tariffs would also harm u s industry by stepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in japan for semiconductors u s firms are trying to sell here the american approach is full of contradictions jardine fleming s edwards said if they want to expand u s exports the last thing they want to do is hit the makers of the final products because that hurts the final market edwards said but other analysts said the dispute reflects not just u s concern over what it sees as a strategic industry but also frustration with japan s vast surplus some analysts argued that to solve the semiconductor problem japan may have to take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact carole ryavec an analyst at salomon brothers asia ltd said the major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic economy and move away from an export dependent economy reuter   japan in last ditch effort to save chip pact japan has launched a last ditch effort to salvage its computer micro chip pact with the united states sending a letter to top american policy makers setting out its case and instructing its producers to cut output further we must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe ministry of international and industry miti deputy director general masaji yamamoto told reporters if hasty action is taken in the united states it will create very serious problems the reagan administration s economic policy is expected to meet thursday to review japanese compliance with the bilateral agreement hammered out last year under the pact tokyo agreed to stop selling cut price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of american semiconductors washington has accused japan of reneging on the deal by selling low priced chips in asia and by failing to boost american imports and has threatened to take retaliatory action in an effort to save the agreement miti is asking japanese chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic demand and reduce the incentive to export yamamoto said that japan will slash output of kilobit dynamic random access and erasable programmable read only memory chips by pct in the second quarter this follows a cutback of more than pct in the first three months of the year he said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of chips available for export through unregulated distributors in the so called grey market we have almost no grey market he said supply is diminishing to help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented miti called in the president of japan s largest semiconductor maker nec corp nipn t last week he said it is also issuing specific instructions on production to the japanese subsidiary of texas instruments inc and industry minister hajime tamura spelled out the steps japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed for u s understanding in a letter to top american policy makers the letter was sent today to u s secretary of state george schultz treasury secretary james baker commerce secretary malcolm baldrige and u s representative clayton yeutter the four who make up the economic policy council are expected to consider evidence presented by u s chip maker micron technology inc dram o of cut price japanese sales in hong kong yamamoto admitted that oki electric industry co s hong kong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level but denied that it was dumping chips at rock bottom prices if the united states uses this as proof of dumping we will present our rebuttal he said the sales though were inappropriate in the light of miti s advice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well above production costs to avoid any hint of dumping he said he also called the case strange but he stopped short of endorsing japanese newspaper accusations that oki had been trapped into making the sales he did say though that micron publicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same day they were made and that oki was unable to locate the person who had bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week reuter   japan march interim surplus falls japan s customs cleared surplus fell to billion dlrs in the first days of march from a billion surplus a year earlier the ministry of

industry miti acted to tighten restrictions on microchip exports to countries other than the u s to preserve a u s japan pact on semiconductor but major japanese chipmakers doubt its usefulness a miti spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters trading houses applying for a miti export licence will be required to show such a certificate but those without it will not automatically be denied licences he said but some industry officials predicted any government measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the world semiconductor market remained weak u s government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the july agreement japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey market sales by third party brokers who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in japan and higher prices based on production costs and set for japanese makers under the agreement the miti spokesman said if the percentage of grey market is increasing for one specific company it suggests they are distributing their products through their sales network knowing they will be exported by some means in that case we will ask them what they are doing to reduce the figure miti earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by pct in first quarter spokesmen for the firms said but they doubt the usefulness of the latest move as long as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market prices there will be people who want to exploit the gap to make money a hitachi ltd hit t spokesman said reuter   japan opens home market to u s fish japan has agreed to drop barriers to american caught herring and pollock opening the way for  ments that could reach mln dlrs annually u s representative clayton yeutter announced yeutter said the accord was reached after extensive bilateral negotiations that ended earlier today in tokyo he said the commerce department estimated u s  ments of processed pollock products and herring should rise to mln dlrs this year and to more than mln dlrs annually in later years there was no immediate assessment of the value of current u s  ments but officials said the pact would lift quotas to the point that americans would be able to nearly all the pollock and herring ordered by japanese firms at the same time yeutter said washington was temporarily suspending a complaint with the general agreement on tariffs and gatt that japan was unfairly curbing imports of the two fish he said the complaint would be reviewed later this year after an assessment to see if japan lived up to the agreement reuter   japan s chip makers angered by u s sanction plans japanese computer chip makers reacted angrily to news the united states plans to take retaliatory action against them for allegedly failing to live up to an agreement on in computer microchips electronic industries association of japan eiaj chairman shoichi saba stated eiaj believes that it is premature and even irrational to attempt an assessment of the impact of the agreement and our efforts to comply with it only six months after concluding the agreement we urge u s governmental authorities to reconsider the decision made to evaluate fairly the results of japanese efforts in implementing the objectives of the agreement and to resist emotional biases he said yesterday washington announced plans to slap as much as mln dlrs in tariffs on japanese imports in retaliation for what is sees as japan s failure to comply with the terms of the pact the agreement struck late last year after months of heated negotiations called on japan to stop selling cut price chips on world markets and to buy more american made semiconductors to salvage the pact tokyo has instructed its chip makers to slash production and has helped establish a multi lateral organisation designed to promote chip imports saba said that japanese chip companies have pledged three mln dlrs over the next five years to the new organisation and expressed regret that no american company has seen fit to join this suggests that american semiconductor manufacturers may not be really  ed in participating in the japanese market he said reuter

pressures in the international economy are as strong as ever reflecting financial deficits payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries despite great potential developing economies are still confronted by grave difficulties particularly debt he added the basis for the talks is the gatt ministerial declaration last september in punta del este uruguay and the subsequent negotiating plan agreed in geneva it is essential that we first reaffirm here our commitment to implementing that plan as scheduled hata said hata added it is not constructive to speed up negotiations in some areas at the expense of others in order to rebuild the free system it is important for each participant to have domestic policies that will serve this end as part of its contribution japan plans in april to fundamentally improve its generalised system of preferences for industrial and mining products to make japan s domestic market more open to developing countries he said reuter

still ongoing japanese agriculture ministry officials said a study of agriculture subsidies by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd is still under way and will be completed sometime next month the officials said the study has been inaccurate so far and they said japan would comment on the final results a reuter report from washington yesterday said the study has found that japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies the study has not been officially released due to objections from some countries japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept the release of the study the agriculture ministry officials said oecd directors are expected to approve the release at a meeting in mid may one agriculture ministry source said the study so far was based on the years japanese subsidies have dropped sharply since then partly because of tight budgetary policy and foreign currency factors have also changed he said the study is unfair and unacceptable because it does not take account of various differences in farming conditions in each country such as geography the source said he said it is highly likely that the final study will show japan has the highest farm subsidies in the world this would increase foreign pressure to open japan s farm market further but this would have little impact on japan s agriculture policy he said without giving further details a main purpose of the study is to clarify export subsidies by major exporting nations like the united states and the european community but japan is a major importer he said reuter   japan says u s japan microchip pact working japanese officials sought to convince the u s that a u s japan pact on microchip is working ahead of an april deadline set by the u s for them to prove their case we are implementing the agreement in good faith and the situation does not run counter to the pact osamu watanabe director of the ministry of international and industry s miti americas and oceanic division told foreign reporters the effects of the measures we have taken and are taking are emerging in the market place he said u s officials have repeatedly accused japanese microchip makers of violating the pact by continuing to sell at below cost in markets outside japan and the united states the agreement signed last september aimed at halting predatory japanese pricing policies and increasing u s semiconductor firms access to the japanese market the comments by miti officials followed a call by prime minsiter yasuhiro nakasone to clear up any misunderstandings on the u s side about the pact watanabe said yukio honda director of miti s industrial electronics division denied that japanese chipmakers were selling at below cost in third countries miti s call to japanese chip makers last month to cut production of key memory chips in the first quarter of this year has begun to dry up the source of cheap chips for sale in the non regulated grey market honda said the grey market exports from japan are shrinking now but in contrast u s and south korean companies are expanding market share because of their cheaper prices honda said miti plans to take further steps to reduce the excess supply of inexpensive chips which developed in japan after the pact was formed because of a slump in japanese semiconductor exports to the united states he added the ministry will soon release its supply demand guidelines for the second quarter and suggested production volumes are likely to be lower than that for the first quarter he said despite businessmen s ingenuity in finding ways around any artificial controls regulation of supply and demand should bring positive results watanabe said i am optimistic he added reuter   japan to ask chip makers to slash output further the ministry of international and industry will ask japanese computer microchip makers to further slash output in the second quarter in an effort to save its semiconductor pact with the united states miti officials said the united states has accused japan of reneging on the semiconductor

cut price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of american chips to reduce some of its huge surplus miti anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement has been pressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export last month the ministry asked japanese chip makers to reduce first quarter output by pct to meet that request they had to slash production by pct over the final six weeks of the first quarter if that reduced production level were maintained through to the end of june second quarter output would come in pct below that of the first three months of the year miti officials who declined to be identified said the ministry has not yet decided on the extent of the second quarter cutback one said that

and cut production of key memory microchips from next month in line with government attempts to ward off u s sanctions company spokesmen said the moves might persuade the u s to call off the sanctions despite obstacles to full implementation of the plans analysts said the tariffs will affect about mln dlrs worth of products and are in retaliation for japan s alleged failure to honour a semiconductor pact in announcing the sanctions last friday president reagan said japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatory pricing and open japan s market to foreign products but u s representative clayton yeutter said yesterday on u s television that the u s is willing to drop the tariffs if japan shows a clear indication that it will open its markets to u s goods the ministry of international and industry miti has urged producers to slash output of the chips by pct in the second quarter following a call to reduce production by more than pct the previous quarter miti also urged makers to boost chip imports analysts said the moves could encourage washington to cancel the tariffs ahead of next month s meeting between prime minister yasuhiro nakasone and president reagan the u s wants to be satisfied it has rattled its sword and shown that it can and will do business said analyst nick edwards at jardine fleming securities ltd in tokyo but analysts cautioned that although japanese producers can cut output boosting imports the key to u s withdrawal of the sanctions is more difficult the u s does not have the low end consumer ic s integrated circuits that the japanese need for consumer products they re well supplied here said richard may senior analyst at barclays de zoete wedd ltd in tokyo the u s leads in production of medium and high end ic s but

tomorrow with high level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral imbalance which last year amounted to billion dlrs in japan s favour on the following two days the topics will range from multilateral talks under the auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and gatt to such bilateral problems as super computers the structural talks are intended to be free wheeling discussions among senior officials tomorrow s topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing and the implications of government budget deficits these talks come at a particularly delicate time for the japanese government which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more some u s officials complained japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports as washington wants japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge u s budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the imbalance that budget deficit has meant that the u s is buying more imports japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft bill before the senate as a nation following adverserial practices it condemns japan without due process one japanese official said that reference spoils what is otherwise a well thought out bill introduced by democratic senator lloyd bentsen he said japan is also not totally happy with the administration s bill particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory action by the u s officials said nevertheless japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position especially with the threat of a bill overhanging them we have no leverage one official admitted as a result tokyo is striving to meet u s complaints about its practices in a variety of fields including super computers the u s is pressing for greater access to the japanese

diplomats said they believed his chances of success were slim boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and widespread opposition to his tax reform plans nakasone will be hard pressed to come up with anything new to tell u s president ronald reagan and key u s congressmen they said news of the week long visit starting april coincided with news that japan recorded a billion dlr surplus last month more than pct higher than a year earlier it also came one day after the reagan administration s economic policy council decided to take retaliatory action against japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint agreement on computer microchips nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages one designed to pep up japan s sagging economy and imports in the short term the other to redirect the country in the medium term away from its over dependence on exports for growth but government officials said political infighting could rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent one from seeing the light of day nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up a package of short term economic measures until after its budget passed parliament because he feared that would amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate but his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the u s virtually empty handed nakasone today ordered his ruling liberal democratic party ldp to come up with its own measures he can then tell reagan the ldp package will form the basis of the government s plans without losing face in parliament over the budget political analysts said officials working on the government s short term economic package said it would probably include rate cuts on loans by government corporations deregulation measures to pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in the form of lower prices and accelerated public investment they said a record portion of state investment planned for the entire fiscal year will take place in the first half probably over pct diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy reagan who is under pressure from the democrat controlled u s congress to take greater action to cut the huge american deficit to complement the short term measures nakasone is also likely to present reagan with details of japan s longer term economic plans a high ranking advisory body headed by former bank of japan governor haruo maekawa is expected to come up with a final report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days before nakasone is scheduled to leave for washington its recommendations are designed as a follow up to maekawa s report last year on economic restructuring and are likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as agricultural reform and land policy officials said while wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed as possible they said the political realities might force them to water down some of the committee s recommendations a subcommittee is considering what the japanese economy might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes massive restructuring officials said the subcommittee projects that the current account surplus will fall to less than two pct of japan s total output or gross national product around or last year the surplus which measures in goods and services amounted to over four pct of gnp the subcommittee

before the april deadline set by washington for the tariffs to take effect tokyo is expected to propose a joint u s japan investigation of american claims that japanese companies are dumping cut price

washington imposed the tariffs any japanese action would probably be taken under article of the general agreement on tariffs and gatt they said if that article were invoked gatt would set up a panel to consider the legality of the u s action but officials here said they hope that can be avoided it may be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the united states may lift its decision at an early date tamura said in announcing the u s sanctions yesterday president ronald reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he had evidence that japan was no longer dumping chips in world markets and had opened up its own market
